23-CCB-0410,"DOMINGUEZ v. BURBACH, et al",https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/6360,GERALD BURBACH DID NOT SEND THE VIDEOS. THE VIDEOS WERE CREATED BY AND POSTED BY ASHLEY CHERYL BURBACH,"As a victim of unauthorized online harassment, bullying, and cyberstalking, I have endured significant emotional, psychological, and reputational harm. The unauthorized posting of a video containing my copyrighted material without my consent has resulted in a profound invasion of my privacy. This violation has led to a cascade of detrimental effects, including:

Emotional Trauma: I have experienced intense feelings of fear, anxiety, and vulnerability, which have been persistent and debilitating. The constant worry about further exposure and harassment has severely impacted my daily life.

Privacy Violation: The non-consensual use and dissemination of my video have left me feeling exposed and powerless. This invasion of my personal space and rights has been a source of ongoing distress.

Reputational Harm: The widespread availability of this video online has damaged my reputation, both personally and professionally. This has led to embarrassment and potential long-term consequences for my career and social relationships.

Psychological Stress: The situation has significantly strained my mental health, necessitating the need for professional counseling. I have had to invest time and resources in seeking therapeutic support to cope with the trauma.

Social and Relationship Impact: This incident has caused me to withdraw from social interactions and has placed a strain on my relationships with family, friends, and colleagues.

Relief Sought:

In light of the above-mentioned harm, I am seeking the following relief:

Small Claims Compensation: I am pursuing compensation through a small claims process for the emotional, psychological, and reputational damages I have suffered. This compensation is sought to cover the costs associated with counseling, legal fees, and the broader impact on my life.

Take Down of Infringing Videos: I am requesting the immediate removal of the unauthorized video(s) from all platforms where they have been posted. This step is crucial in mitigating further harm and restoring my sense of privacy and control.

This relief is essential not only for my personal recovery but also to set a precedent that such violations of privacy and copyright are unacceptable and have serious consequences. I trust that the small claims process will recognize the severity of the harm inflicted upon me and grant the appropriate relief as a means of justice and restoration."
23-CCB-0408,"Rucker v. Dillard, et al",https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/6317,"The respondent,James Dillard, made a misrepresentation in all of his takedown notices and his counter-notices. The following are the words that made up the misrepresentation, YouTube asked the following questions to James Dillard and he gave them these answers: 

""How much of your copyrighted work is used? 2 Hours and 18 Minutes

How is the market for your original work affected by this use? It Diminishes the value of the original work since there is more than one copy in the same market. It reduces the effectiveness of future engagements with my subscribers by making them less interested in viewing the immediate release or live performance.

Does this use significantly transform your original work, or does it serve the same purpose? Same purpose, commentary as the original. They did not change the meaning in any way.

Does this use fall into an exception to copyright protection? No. Fair use does not cover this since the topic is the same.
They are using this only to defame my channel and reduce the effectiveness of the original content.""

In all of his takedown notices he puts in the following legal language:

Country where copyright applies: US
I state UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY that:
I am the owner, or an agent authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
I have a good faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
This notification is accurate.
I acknowledge that under Section 512(f) of the DMCA any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing may be subject to liability for damages.
I understand that abuse of this tool will result in termination of my YouTube channel.
Authorized Signature: James Dillard","James Dillard used several different cyberbullying strategies in order to get all of my channels deleted from the YouTube platform. At first he used privacy notices and that didn't work. Then he misrepresented the copyright takedown notices and combined with filing a copyright claims board, docket#: 23-CCB-0266, he was able to have all my channels removed due to youtube receiving legal documentation from him. On top of that he filled 2 federal cases against me and the other content creators but we were never served as an attempt to get a default judgement against us. Because of his activities I was no longer able to earn revenue from YouTube. James Dillard is not only targeting me when it comes to the misrepresentation, he has targeted other content creators that have been critical with his content as well. He used the same abuse of copyright take down notices even though we have all won our own counter notifications against him but he keeps doing it. 

Due to his misrepresentation DMCA claims, I have been harmed for months. The relief I'm seeking would be the following:

1)A cease and desist from James Dillard. That means no more privacy notices, no more false claims for infringement through the copyright claims board, from YouTube, or any other social media platform. Not putting my name (legal name or alias name) on any legal documents. That includes his social media friends such as ""Prism"". Also a cease and desist from the use of any of my images, photos or content on all social media platforms. I will do the same as well, there will be no future content from me or any of my channels regarding him. I want the respondent, James Dillard to STOP making misrepresentations. That includes stop sending false takedown notices and counter-notices to me and other content creators that use fair use.

2)Having his claim for infringement, docket number #:23-CCB-0266, to be dismissed with prejudice so he can not file it again.

3)Preventing James Dillard from copyrighting his work with case#: 1-12843823841 with copyright.gov. He only created that case as a stalling strategy and to further harm me and the other content creators that used a screen shot photo of him as a thumbnail.

4)I'm seeking damages of $5,000. The amount includes filing fees, current legal representation, future legal representation, potential loss revenue from YouTube, my interest in freedom of expression, along with pain and suffering from not being able to defend myself against his false allegations.

5)To have James Dillard to drop both federal cases that contain my name. The cases will be attached to this claim. Also to drop any false cyberstalking reports, false TRO's, and any other police reports that contain my name.

6)Since the respondent has made videos degrading my reputation online, he needs to write a formal apology to the YouTube Legal & Copyright Department and suggest to them it was all a mistake and to have them restore ALL of my YouTube channels back as if nothing happened. There were no community violations that were done by Kenneth Rucker.

7)I would highly need the CCB staff attorneys to give me information about obtaining a subpoena under 17 USC 512 (h), which may help me obtain information from an online service provider to identify the other respondent on this claim, James Dillard's online friend that helped him create these false misrepresentation claims, ""Prism"". She specifically has been making online threats towards me and other content creators. The threats have been ongoing for months and it includes financial and physical. It's gotten so bad that I had to file a cybercrime report with the FBI and my local police department against both of them. James Dillard may have given her my contact information through the YouTube copyright counter notices that I sent and I'm concerned for my safety.

8)Because he has been abusing and violating the Digital Milliennium Copyright Act - 17 U.S.C. 512(f) DMCA law, James Dillard needs to be permanently removed from the YouTube platform."

He didn't create the video and he is not the owner of my film or songs. So why is he fighting me on Youtube for my original works? He is claiming it to be 
""fair-use"" calling it a review video which is NOT True. But the point is, he did NOT make this video. How can he counter claim it?? I feel Youtube should investigate the issue before accepting a counter claim.","Stressful, I'm trying to enjoy my life and the holidays, my mom passed away last year. I'm still grieving her, and I am the caregiver/legal guardian of my older brother that has autism, he is non verbal, a lot of work.

23-CCB-0396,Luke v. Smith,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/6054,"These are the exact quotes from the counter-notice that Keegan Smith sent to me via YouTube:

""Because I [Keegan Smith] own the full rights to the video, this strike is false and he [Tiffany Luke] should be getting in legal trouble for it, so its a fraudulent strike, and I 100% own the thumbnail.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good faith belief the material was removed due to a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.""","There is no question that I (Tiffany Luke) am the owner of the video that Keegan is claiming the rights to. The video features my husband and dog and was filmed in my living room. The video was also posted originally to my Instagram account back in 2020 and my YouTube account in 2021, way before Keegan started reposting them on their account in 2022.

It is incredibly harmful for Keegan to claim ownership over my video that I worked so hard to create. I was the one who put in all the time and energy into planning, coordinating, shooting, and editing the video. Additionally, my husband has not given Keegan permission to post his likeness.

Additionally, it's also harmful that Keegan is claiming ownership even though they know full well that they are not the owner of the video. Soon after my initial copyright removal request was approved by YouTube, Keegan had sent me an email through his clickyt0021@gmail.com email address under the name Kiara admitting they had uploaded content that did not belong to them and begging me to withdraw my copyright removal request. 

It has been incredibly stressful for me to deal with someone claiming ownership of my work and now having to take the time to put together this claim and all the evidence to ensure that my copyright ownership is held in place.

As for relief, I want Keegan to withdraw their counter-notice and to stop harassing me via email and through counter-notices about getting their YouTube account back."

He was not the producer of the interview. I was the one who talk him what to do. Please find attached the email were I was the one who made decisions. He also did not organise the questions for the interview, which came from three years of research in the University of Edinburgh. He was only pay to record my work because I was interviewed John Jairo Velasquez. It is also no clear how he mentioned that he own the work because he is John Jairo Velasquez's family.

On 5th June 2021, I want to highlight that the address YouTube provided is fake and there is a similar address were Sebastian Lugo lived. I think that he personated John Jairo Velasquez’s son to convince YouTube of s ownership he does not have. However, to be the son of a person of an interview does not make Sebastian Velasquez an owner. He was never involved with my PhD work and he does not have any right in relation with this work. Lugo constantly published my material in his two channels Popeye Arrepentido and Nextark. Lugo was the one who also had access to my work. There is also how a channel, Popeye Arrepentido that is registered in America can have an address in Colombia.

I have contacted Joseph Wagner for the removal of the infringing content before a DMCA notice. He responded to my request by removing any credit he had on his works description.","This has caused me stress, as it is very hard for a non-U.S. resident to start a copyright infringement claim in a federal court.

23-CCB-0340,Hill v. Aichwalder,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/5485,I swear under penalty of perjury that I have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled by mistake or because of misidentification of the material.,"To begin I must state that the particular copyright work (Soccer Skeleton Overhead Kick Soccer Player Halloween Moon) that is the subject of this proceeding was intended to be available (offered for sale) solely through my own sales account located on the Amazon.com Merch on Demand marketplace platform. The copyright work was uploaded by me to the Amazon.com Merch on Demand platform to be sold only as a design printed on physical products such as shirts, tote bags, hoodies, etc. No digital download of this product is or was offered nor any authorized by myself or Amazon.com. The only method anyone can legally obtain this copyright work is through the purchase of products offered by Amazon.com that include the design printed on it. All other uses are unauthorized.

The activity of Erica Aichwalder has contributed to a loss of sales revenue that is incalculable due to the nature of this type of copyright infringement. The respondent somehow obtained an unauthorized copy of my copyright work and created a listing on etsy.com which offered it for sale to the public as a digital download in the form of a PNG file with transparent background. 

The Respondents listing title included the phrase ""Soccer Skeleton Overhead Kick Soccer Player Halloween Moon, Png For Shirt, Png Files For Sublimation, Digital Download, Printable"" which mislead all buyers to believe that Erica Aichwalder had the rights to resell my copyright work and that they, the buyer, were also being given the right to use and resell my copyright work on products such as T-shirts and other items that the design could be printed on. 

The respondent's activity has helped to distribute my copyright work without my permission to an unknown quantity of people, both within and outside the United States, that in turn may and most likely have created products which compete with my own listings located on the Amazon.com marketplace. This includes but is not limited to using my unauthorized copyright work to sell products not only on other platforms such as a private ecommerce website, etsy.com, teepublic.com, redbubble.com, zazzle.com but also Amazon.com as well which directly competes with my own original listings created with my own copyright work. 

The respondent's activity has directly contributed to and increased the unauthorized use and spread of my copyright work both within and outside the United States. The result is that my ability to sell and profit from my own copyright work has been diminished significantly.   

In fact I have had to issue numerous takedown requests since listing my copyright work on the Amazon.com marketplace and I have no doubt that some may be the result of Erica Aichwalder's activity which allowed people to purchase an unauthorized hi-resolution copy of my copyright work for a mere $1.20

This not only harms me financially but contributes to my mental stress as well as adding extra work load to my schedule which I do not get paid for. Rather than using my time to create designs I am forced to waste my time tracking down unauthorized copies of my work and trying to protect it from those like the respondent who deem that theft is okay."
23-CCB-0338,Schultz v. Thompson,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/5440,"This was an obvious matter of fair use. Percentage, subject matter, and otherwise make it salient for public consumption and access. Thompson's behavior and words are shocking and dangerous and YouTube was well aware of Thompson at this time, therefore they should answer to the content.

I believe that the copyright board should rule on whether or not my posting the entire video a month later was infringement or not. This is a matter I have had to take to the courts in order to prevent further harm. In the video that I posted, Mr. Thompson clearly describes putting a hypothetical person through the exact torment he placed me through. It was very near an admission and I believe posting it was vital to the knowledge of users on YouTube. Under significant duress and determined to never have someone suffer Thompson's wrath with copyright abuse, I posted the video because I believe YouTube is denying and ignoring the stark reality of predators utilizing their platforms for very devastating utility.  I welcome judgment on the issue of whether or not Thompson, who most likely doesn't have a copyright for this video, is infringement and not fair use as it demonstrates the operations of bad actors on the internet. I believe I acted in good faith and for good purpose to the public good.","Mr. Thompson routinely infringed my copyrights, prior to registration on many counts (I am looking for aid in retrieving every stolen mp4 or video Thompson published, and I would like immediate preregistration for a feature film to be released next year). Additionally, he used live chat function from YouTube to harass me in order to provoke content, which is a matter of jurisdiction for the state of California. The copyright infringement, nonetheless operates in that context. This is a person who steals people's copyrights and posts hundreds of edited clips in order to harass, shame and defame. I want every video returned to me that Thompson published since 2021 and I want them registered and I would like to take him to court prior to March 2024 in order to obtain actionable damages and special damages on the infringement of what is my content to register."

She admitted in her counterclaim that the video I created my work from was a publicly released video by law enforcement, then further on she claimed that I can't claim copyright on my work involving that video because it didn't ""belong"" to me. I believe this to be an inaccurate counterclaim aimed at bullying me, a person with 5k subscribers, into backing down from her, a person with 34k subscribers and a lot more income from youtube than myself, as I am new.","Tracy Anne (Chasing) used my work without permission and without credit or link to my video, which would have brought views and income to my channel. By using my work in this manner, she in effect stole (by youtube's RPM of 6.25 currently) $1170.00 from myself and from others who created the additional material she played during her live stream, not including the Super Chats she received while deliberately placing the videos in a manner that hid the source channel information from her viewers."

Authorized Signature: Bastien Casalta""

Reason for Misrepresentation 1:
In response to the takedown notice issued by TMG, represented by Mr. Bastien Casalta, I wish to assert that this notice presents a fundamental misrepresentation regarding the nature of my videos and their relation to copyright law, particularly the ""fair use"" provisions.

Mr. Casalta's notice states ""UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY"" that he believes my use of the material ""is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law."" I contend that this assessment is fundamentally flawed for the following reasons:

Purpose and Character of Use: My videos aren't replicas or mere reproductions of the original rugby matches. They undergo considerable transformation. Using CoachPaint, I edit, annotate, and introduce graphical effects to illuminate rugby laws' intricacies. This transformative use, accompanied by my educational commentary, establishes a different purpose from the original broadcasts.

Nature of the Copyrighted Work: The original rugby matches, while copyrighted, serve a distinct purpose from my videos. My videos are analytical and educational, not replays. They provide a comprehensive view of specific game aspects, underscoring the essence of fair use.

Amount and Substantiality of the Portion Used: I employ only selected segments of the game, representing a tiny fraction of the entire content. Out of 2,000-3,000 rugby events in a game, my focus is on just 10-25. This selective use emphasizes the educational aspect, differing starkly from the original broadcast's intent.

Effect on the Market: My videos address a unique niche, focusing on refereeing analysis—a perspective barely covered on platforms like YouTube. They neither substitute nor detract from the original broadcasts but foster a deeper appreciation of the game.

Mr. Casalta's declaration, asserting that my content's use ""is not authorized by the law,"" seems to dismiss the well-established provisions of ""fair use"" within copyright law. The law explicitly allows for transformative, educational use like mine.

Given the tenets of fair use and the unique nature of my content, TMG's claim appears to be a misrepresentation. I would like to remind the you of Section 512(f) of the DMCA, which Mr. Casalta referenced: any person who ""knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing may be subject to liability for damages."" I believe my videos squarely fall within fair use, and TMG's takedown notice, in failing to recognize this, has done a disservice to the broader rugby community and YouTube's platform.","I would like to highlight the extensive repercussions and losses that I, as a dedicated and hardworking content creator, have faced due to World Rugby's undue actions.

Projected Revenue Loss: The World Cup represents a significant influx in viewership for rugby-related content. Using a single video as a benchmark that garnered 230k views and generated $900 in a short span, and juxtaposing it against my historic channel metrics, I was poised to make around $1,500 for this one video alone. Had I been able to post the 8 videos that were planned for the duration of the World Cup, with a conservative estimate of $500 each in revenue, the projected earnings would have been $4,000. This amount excludes potential revenue from increased sponsorships and partnerships, which are commonplace during such high-profile events.

Opportunity Cost: The World Cup is a quadrennial event, which means lost opportunities during this period are not recoverable until four years later. This is not just a month of lost revenue; it's a loss of four years' worth of specialized content capitalization.

Algorithmic Penalization: YouTube's algorithm is intricate. With these unjust strikes, my channel has faced a significant algorithmic setback, seeing a 60-80% drop in views on older videos. Given the way YouTube operates, regaining this lost ground is not just about waiting for the strikes to be removed; it can take months, even years, to reestablish a channel's standing.

Loss of Potential Subscribers: Considering the heightened interest in rugby during the World Cup, my channel's growth was stunted at a crucial juncture. Given the ripple effect of every subscriber bringing in more through word of mouth, shares, and recommendations, the loss isn't just of the immediate subscribers, but of the potential exponential growth I was poised to experience.

Reputation and Trust Damage: Trust, once lost, is hard to regain. The perceived legitimacy of my content has been questioned due to these takedowns, affecting not only viewer trust but also potential collaborations, sponsorships, and partnership opportunities. This loss, although intangible, has long-term repercussions on my earning potential and credibility.

Emotional and Mental Distress: Beyond the financial and reputational losses, the stress and emotional turmoil caused by this ordeal shouldn't be understated. I've invested time, effort, and passion into my channel, and to see it unjustly penalized takes a toll on my well-being.

Given the depth and breadth of the damages and losses sustained, a claim of $30,000 isn't arbitrary or capricious. It's a justified compensation for the multifaceted negative impacts I've been subjected to. Beyond this monetary claim, I reiterate the need for a public apology from World Rugby and the immediate removal of these baseless strikes against my channel and abstain from repeatedly targeting my content with baseless claims that show a blatant disregard for the principles of Fair Use and copyright laws."

The specific claim made in the counternotice was ""I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good faith belief that the affected material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled and that I am the merchant subject to the DMCA Takedown Notice
referred to above or I am authorised to act on behalf of that merchant.""
I initially correspondend with the respondent on 8/6/23 via Facebook and Facebook Messanger, the day that I became aware of the copyright infringement. Copies of all correspondence are included as supplemental documents. In our initial communication, I asked the respondent to take down the image or add attribution. The respondent agreed to add attribution to remedy the unauthorized use of the image, and indicated that would be completed by 8/9/23. The initial DMCA takedown notice was sent on 8/14/23, when several days had elapsed since the 8/9 date the respondent had provided, with no communication from the respondent that they needed additional time and continued promotion of the website with the infringing image posted. After the infrining content was initially taken offline on 8/15, the respondent contacted me by email asking for the violation request to be removed, suggesting that she had fulfilled the condition of adding attribution by adding a ""link"" and saying that she would take down the photo if the ""link"" was not acceptable. When I had checked the website on 8/15, several hours before I received confirmation that the infringing content was taken down, there was no ""link"" or attribution accompanying the image. I indicated in my email response in part that based on her actions up to that point, she needed to find a different image to use for that product listing. The full response is included in the copies of the correspondence, but she said in part ""I'm happy to do that...I understand your rights and your concerns."" 

Several days later I saw that the URL's that were taken down by Shopify were restored, my content was gone, and I expected that was the end of it, and I had no intention of pursing it further. On 9/2/23 I was scrolling through Facebook and saw a sponsored post for the respondent's website. I clicked on it and saw that the listing and my photograph were back on the site, and there was no attempt to provide attribution for the image in the listing. I sent a second DMCA takedown request to Shopify on 9/2/23 and received notification from Shopify on 9/5 that the content listed as infringing in the original Takedown Notice had been taken offline. About one hour later I received notifcation from Shopfiy that the the respondent had responded to the DMCA Takedown Notice with a Counter Notice, indicating that the content was taken down as the result of a mistake or misidentification of the work. The email indicates that the material may be replaced and access no longer disabled within 10-14 days unless Shopify receives notice that I have filed an action against the Merchant. At this point the infringing image is not posted, but the 10-14 business days has not yet elapsed. 

Based on my communication via Facebook and email with the respondent prior to sending the second takedown notice, the respondent made a misrepresentation in filing the counter claim, and knew that the misrepresentation was false, because they had already acknowledged that I am the copyright owner, acknowledged that they used the image withouth permission, and had agreed to discontinue use of the image after they failed to add attribution in a timely manner. Even though the respondent claims that they did add a ""link"" as attribution prior to the content being taken down the first time, I did not ever see evidence attribution was added, and screen capture video and images of the website after the repost show that there was no attribution for the image, so it is not possible that this is a miscommunication about attribution.","I am seeking damages for the harm caused by the misrepresentation. When I became aware of the copyright infringement I immediately notified the respondent but offered the respondent continued use the image contingent on attribution being added, which would have allowed the unauthorized use to be quickly and simply resolved for both parties. Instead of just adding image attribution to the written description for the listing, the respondent chose to continue to use the image without authorization, and then to further escalate the unauthorized use by making false statements in the counter-notice they filed, which will result in their ability to repost the image as a listing photo on their site. Ranunculus corms are typically shipped in the fall in the United States, and although they are dormant, are a perishable product. As a result of the second DMCA takedown, the specific listing using the work is not active on the website, which means that customers are not able to order the inventory the respondent has purchased. Without taking additional legal steps against the respondent, the misrepresentation in the counter claim will allow the respondent to have this listing with the photo active again, and continue to profit off the unauthorized use of my work."

As the Designated DMCA Agent of https://shemale6.com, I understand that content creators may wish to have their videos removed from our website, and we are working diligently to improve our approach in this regard.

However, I'm a bit unsure how we can be held responsible for entire pages like https://www.shemale6.com/search/Porcelaingoirl-fe/, which is solely owned by shemale6.com. Personally, I believe this is an abuse of the DMCA system. It's worth noting that we've already removed thousands of search queries in response to DMCA requests.

23-CCB-0224,Davis v. Milano,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/3773,"""Etsy received a report of copyright infringement from Michelle Milano alleging that certain content in your Etsy shop infringe their intellectual property.""

This board has repeatedly informed Michelle that her copyright does not cover preexisting material or the idea or process of creating a Fairy Orb. Her copyright protects her specific look of her Fairy Orb.

Michelle has also stated on more than one occasion to have extensive knowledge of copyright law. Therefore it is reasonable to believe that she knew the protections and limitations of her copyright registration each time she filed a DMCA against me and multiple other sellers on Etsy.

Every time Michelle files a claim with the board, she adjusts what materials she uses to create her Fairy Orbs. In her amended claim from 23-CCB-0066, she now includes ""a ribbon to hang and hide the topper."" This information was not included in her copyright registration or her other claims. It also doesn't appear to be something she did in 2012. However, this is something that I have always done with my work. I am not trying to state that Michelle can't use a ribbon, but that it would appear she has chosen to include this information to support her allegation that my work is a derivative of her own.

I believe she is doing this because, as this board has told her, my work does not contain a clay hand-sculpted fairy strikingly similar to hers. My work does not include any fairy. 

Etsy has a very powerful tool for reporting intellectual property infringement. https://www.etsy.com/ipmanager Since Michelle has targeted so many sellers, I assume she is utilizing this tool. I signed up for this tool myself to investigate. It allows you to search keywords and bring up listings to report multiple listings simultaneously (I believe Etsy limits you to 500 listings per report). 

When I searched for ""fairy orbs"" with Etsy's IP manager, I did not see any listings that were substantially similar to hers or mine. However, when I searched ""witch ball"" and ""spell ball,"" my work and the works of other impacted sellers appeared. 

This tool relies on searching listing titles, product descriptions, and tags to identify keywords and produce search results. Since I did not use the keywords ""fairy orbs"" ANYWHERE in my listings, it is reasonable to conclude that my listings would not be displayed if Michelle searched for ""fairy orbs"" within Etsy's IP portal.

With this information, It is reasonable to conclude that Michelle could not have searched for fairy orbs when using this tool to file DMCA takedowns and that she had to have searched for ""witches balls"" and/or ""spell balls.""

Michelle has also shared posts on social media where she states that she deliberately targets certain people. In a Facebook post she shares a screenshot of an email from an upset seller responding to a DMCA that Michelle sent. This is her caption for the screenshot:  ""people like this are the type you deliberately target I've learned.... Smfh- I'll just forward it to the copyright offices attorneys"" 

It would also appear that Michelle only engages in this activity when trying to establish her own business. Her claim in 2021 fell in line with her starting an Etsy shop. These most recent claims have been timed with the launch of her new website and the re-launch of her Etsy shop.

However, in Michelle's amended claim for case 23-CCB-0066, she admits that she files DMCA claims against other makers to mark the anniversary of receiving her copyright:

""This harassment and juvenile tactics STARTED completely from a 2 week DCMA down on Etsy on the ANNIVERSARY of my receiving my first copyright. Which is why it was done at that time, my flagging and DCMA'ing the account(s) had nothing to do with holidays whatsoever, only the ANNIVERSARY of my getting my first copyright.""

Michelle's copyright was granted in September 2012, but her DMCA filings happened in November 2021 and March 2023. These filings do not align with the anniversary of her copyright registration. Furthermore, this admission suggests that she intentionally files these DMCA requests that have real-world impacts on the lives of her victims to celebrate her being granted a copyright registration and not because we are infringing upon her work.

Michelle recently announced a new copyright registration for ""Goddess Globes."" on social media. (VAu001495751 / 2023-03-10) This announcement is video cut with a photo of a woman making an obscene hand gesture, suggesting that this registration is not to protect her work but to try and get back at me now that the legitimacy of the enforcement of her Fairy Orb copyright has come under scrutiny. Her announcement shows no examples of her work and states, ""new items coming soon!!""

Michelle had her Etsy shop shut down for fraudulent practices and doxxing a customer. Since she no longer has access to Etsy, she has recently filed DMCA takedown requests to other makers of spell balls on Pinterest, claiming their photographs as her intellectual property. In addition to Pinterest, Michelle has filed DMCA takedowns on other platforms, including Instagram, where I received two DMCAs for one photo and one video that she falsely claimed was her intellectual property.

All of these facts lead me to no other conclusion than that Michelle knew my work did not infringe upon her copyright but filed 21 DMCA takedown requests on Etsy against me anyway. Therefore, when she informed Etsy that ""certain content in your Etsy shop infringe their intellectual property,"" she was knowingly lying and making false statements.","Financial loss. Whenever the respondent files a DMCA notice against me, I cannot sell my product on Etsy for 12-14 days. I have lost an estimated $648 in potential sales over 48 days. This rate was determined by an average of one sale per day at $13.50. The respondent is aware of this amount, as she has received and viewed an initial invoice sent to her via Paypal for $621 on April 6, 2023. I have since sent two updated invoices for a total of $1,491. She has not responded to any invoices.

While some of my listings can be relisted per DMCA laws, Michelle has not withdrawn any of the 21 complaints against me, which results in reduced traffic to my shop, as my search ranking is affected.

The respondent has used social media platforms in an attempt to falsely accuse me of theft of copyright, damaging my personal and business reputation. The respondent has also engaged in bullying, harassment, and stalking. She continues to make defamatory and libelous statements about me and my business on her social media pages. The loss in sales from this is not calculable. 

Due to the respondent's continued claims with Etsy I have had to spend numerous hours building my own website, as well as purchasing a Shopify subscription at $39 a month, totaling $468 per year, a $12 fee to change my website hosting service to Google Domains for easier setup and $140 towards obtaining a P.O. Box for my safety after the respondent used my personal information gathered from my counter notice to send me harassing mail via USPS, as well as $100 to file this claim to protect my business and character. Additionally, I have spent time rebuilding listings on Etsy, filing counternotices, chasing defamatory posts on social media, and issuing DMCA notices of my own against Michelle. I have spent several hours searching for information about her Fairy Orbs (after she refused me access to her work on two separate occasions), consulting with lawyers, speaking to the police, studying copyright law, reading her filings and claims, reviewing evidence, and building my own CCB case. My billable time for this is $60/hr for 60 hours for $3,600.

These fees total: $5,811

Michelle also (after receiving a cease and desist letter from me that she signed for) published my full name, address, phone number, and email address in two pieces of evidence attached to a publicly available amended claim for case 23-CCB-0066. This has made me feel unsafe and fear for the safety of my family. Michelle has been public about this filing on social media and knowingly posted my private contact information, knowing anyone could view it. I am grateful for this board's quick response in removing that information from public view. 

Michelle has threatened me publicly, stating, ""goodbye 2 ton thief wanna take care of things without an attorney come knock on my door.... I'm more than happy to oblige and settle out of court.... MY way"" and  ""I'm gonna take care of you, you fat fucking cunt."" 

Michelle created a Facebook page called ""Harassment & Cyberstalking,"" where she alleges that she is ""collecting evidence"" against me. However, this is a thinly veiled excuse to humiliate me and try and affect my business further publicly. In one post, Michelle states that the existence of this page is  my fault, stating: ""Lets see....  this all started because someones infringing copyright and refused to stop....""

Most recently, Michelle's actions have led to my TikTok page being permanently banned for ""multiple reports of violent extremism."" My TikTok account was the biggest driver of my sales. While I cannot explicitly prove at this time that Michelle filed the reports that got me banned, the ban happened after reports of my videos about this situation were reported for ""harassment & bullying.""

This ban has halted nearly all traffic to my website and Etsy shop. The total loss in sales from her deliberate actions is incalculable. 

The respondent has also utilized my logo to impersonate me online, where she accuses me of copyright theft and claims my business is being shut down. Michelle has also claimed my photos and video as her own on Instagram, filing two fraudulent DMCA notices against me. I have spent hours chasing these down, responding to them, and filing my own DMCA notices against her to protect my business and reputation.

Since I cannot quantify the lost revenue from the defamation of character and false statements against me, I am seeking an additional $5,000 in damages for the attacks against my business, reputation, and character.

I am also requesting an additional $2,500 in punitive damages for the emotional suffering incurred from her actions.

The total amount of monetary relief I am requesting is $13,311.

I am also requesting the CCB order that Michelle Milano can no longer file DMCA claims without advisement from a competent intellectual property lawyer to prevent her from attacking my business or any other business again. This type of order is not unprecedented; see case 3:22-cv-00578:

23-CCB-0223,finixio Ltd v. Cryptoticker.io GmbH,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/3725,finixio and the finixio logo,Reputational damage - we are seeking $2.500 to cover the expenditure on our side as well as all the fees that cryptoticker earned by wrongfully using our name and logo.
23-CCB-0222,READ ASAP LTD v. Miracle,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/3724,"According to Section 107 of the U.S. Copyright Act, the infringing website in question does not qualify as fair use. Therefore, their claim of having the right to use the content is a misrepresentation.

Let's analyze the four factors that determine fair use:

1）Purpose and character of the use: The purpose of the pirate novel website is not for personal reading but for profit, as evidenced by the presence of advertisements. This constitutes a commercial purpose of use.

b）Nature of the copyrighted work: Creative works are entitled to greater copyright protection than factual works. Our novel is a creative work with a certain degree of originality.

c）Amount and substantiality of the portion used: Users can download the complete PDF version of the novel through this website. As a paid reading work, we generally provide only around 10% of the content for free as a promotional purpose. The website in question has clearly exceeded this limit.

d）Effect of the use upon the market: This factor includes the extent of the harm and other relevant factors. The actions of the pirate website directly lead to a decrease in user retention, reduced click-through rates, diminished advertising revenue, decreased income and quantity of paid or membership-based subscriptions, resulting in significant harm to our company.

Therefore, it can be concluded that the infringing website's claim is a misrepresentation.","Regarding the claim we are pursuing, our company has obtained exclusive authorization from the author to publish our works on our platform. However, a significant number of our exclusive works have been unlawfully placed on a pirate website (https://forum.3ptechies.com) without our permission, and we have been unable to establish contact with the operators of this website. We have made consistent efforts to address this issue by filing complaints through Google search and submitting takedown notices to Google in accordance with the provisions of the DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act) Section 512.

Unfortunately, despite our efforts, the pirate website has falsely claimed to have the right to use our works, resulting in ongoing infringement. Many of our works have been registered with the United States Copyright Office, and their presence on this website unequivocally does not constitute fair use. This unauthorized use directly harms our platform, leading to reduced user retention, decreased click-through rates, diminished advertising revenue, as well as reduced revenue and quantity from paid or membership-based services. The damages inflicted upon our company are substantial.

We request that the operator of this website promptly take down all of our exclusive works, including but not limited to the following URLs:

23-CCB-0217,Fintelegram v. Capital Solutions Ltd,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/3674,"These 2 websites, filled a fake DMCA counternotice. And here you find all the details:

1. They mentioned sending this DMCA from a company called Capital Solutions Ltd with the address 56 Chapman Road STE 105, Newark, Delaware, USA, 19702 and phone number +9018918888
If you check the Delaware Register of Companies, there isn't any company with this name. Plus they used an Indian phone number. We tried to call and is not active. Also, the email domain they used, the website is not existing and used the email account just to email and fill the fake DMCA.

2. They used the sender name Gen Lanza, but if you check, it's the same name present in the articles we asked to shut down for DMCA copyright
https://www.gripeo.com/gennaro-lanza-review/
https://www.gripeo.com/gennaro-lanza/
https://www.criminalaffair.com/int/gennaro-lanza/
Then they used a fake sender name just to counternotice.

Also, they sent about the same links also a second DMCA takedown, but this time with another company, name and email:
Company Gripeo LLC
Email bz@liaisons.co
Name Nathan Howards

They declared in both cases the UK residence. 

But the IP connection was for both from India. It's absolutely clear about the fake DMCA.

Long short story: they sent a fake DMCA using a fake name, fake company, fake address and fake phone number.

You can also realize this from the Lumen database, the website Gripeo.com received hundreds of DMCA takedowns for breaching copyrights.","They are trying to restore the pages with a fake DMCA.
But their IP is from India as for the email received from Google.

We suggest to ask their ID card to verify the identity of their account."
23-CCB-0215,"Gharavi v. FloSports, Inc.",https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/3671,"Misrepresentation: ""I have a good faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law. The information in this notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, I am the owner, or an agent authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.""

Explanation of the misrepresentation: The respondent sent YouTube twenty (20) takedown notices claiming my online content was infringing.  In stating under penalty of perjury that FloSports, Inc. is the “the owner, or an agent authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed”, the respondent did knowingly make twenty (20) misrepresentations because they knew that they were not the actual owner of the copyright to any of my twenty (20) videos to which I own the exclusive copyright.  The aforementioned misrepresentations were critical to YouTube’s decision in that it relied upon said misrepresentations in deciding to take down all twenty (20) videos.","Upon receipt of the twenty (20) misrepresented DMCA notices, YouTube disabled all twenty (20) videos and assessed four (4) copyright strikes against my channel, resulting in the channel being scheduled for termination within seven (7) days pending adjudication of the twenty (20) counter notices.  When a channel is scheduled for termination, no new content can be published.  It took YouTube nineteen (19) days to adjudicate fifteen (15) of the counter notices, resulting in the restoration of my ability to publish.  In addition to the financial harm caused by disabling access to those videos during those nineteen (19) days, over the same time period I was unable to publish my minimum once-daily new content, and as a result, viewership dramatically declined over that time period and still has yet to recover due YouTube’s algorithm deprioritizing channels which do not regularly publish.  Although this has resulted in significant actual monetary damages as well as damage to my reputation, I am willing to defer seeking financial relief if the respondent is willing to agree to stop making misrepresentations and to stop sending false takedown notices."

My (Ricardo) response to the Board: 
This is a misrepresentation as Spotify does not allow Third Parties to use artist's art cover and brand (essentially) to promote other items on different websites. What would Beyonce Knowles and her camp do if he (Jesse) used her works on his site? Why didn't he attempt this on a major artist? 
He targets artists who he knows/thinks may not come after him financially, but who are popular in the Google search space. This is why he purposefully chose me and my song, because I am popular but not at the level of a major artist or label.","Google has told me that I have to file a lawsuit or submit a claim here - to the Copyrights Claim Board - to continue the dispute process, or they will reinstate the Gemtracks link in the search engine. I received this notice today. So I still am ""fighting"" this issue with Gemtracks and Jesse Neo, which is taking time out of my day, causing me mental and emotional stress, and I feel that I am in essence (biblically speaking), David fighting Goliath here...

Relief: Again, I want that Gemtracks link taken down and any fiscal damages available that are fair and reasonable - based on my intellectual property - I want. This company and the lack of ethics and lack of care about me from Jesse; all are unacceptable."

Now most creators would offer the limited explanation above and leave it at that. But I enjoy a unique vantage with regard to YouTube. I am able to use ""Michelle Shocked"" as keyword search and discover uploaded content despite not having access to Content ID. So I am able to detect patterns when content is being monetized across platforms. And so I couldn't help but notice the title of the video, ""5 am in Amsterdam Michelle Shocked"" and ""(Official Music Video)"" from this DMCA claim I filed just a few days after a French publisher contacted me to ""license"" a lyric from ""5 am in Amsterdam"" in a French translation of a book titled ""I Live a Life Like Yours""

Message: Dear Michelle,
I am a junior editor at a small publishing house in Marseille, France, called Le bruit du monde (which roughly translates as ""the sounds of the world"").
We are going to publish a translation into French of the memoir/autobiographical essay of a young Norwegian writer and researcher, Jan Grue. In his memoir, he deals with the issue of being a disabled man in a world that isn't meant for him to fit in, and also tells us about how he eventually came to terms with his extra-ordinary being-in-the-world, and learned to accept it. His voice is strong and we wanted to make it heard to French readers.
In his book, he reminisces on how living in Amsterdam as an exchange student was both a wonderful and trying experience : the cobblestone streets, the canals, the city itself weren't meant to welcome a person in a wheelchair, and yet he came to love it and its atmosphere. He specifically remembers listening to your song again and again, ""5 am in Amsterdam"". He quotes 5 lines of the song in his book, and we were wondering if we could quote those lines too in our edition. Being a huge fan of yours, I thought I'd reach out personally.
Looking forward to hearing from you,
Many thanks for your attention,
Léa

Dear Léa
I'm pleased to hear from you concerning licensing the lyrics from my song ""5 AM in Amsterdam"" for the memoir I LIve a Life Like Yours by Jan Grue.
A few thoughts come to mind:
Why, I wonder, was this not first brought to my attention by Pushkin Press when Mr. Grue's book was published in English, apparently on November 4, 2021? Was there a prior publication in Norway as well?

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/15/books/review/i-live-a-life-like-yours-jan-grue.html

It has been my experience that licensing my lyrics for print publication typically brings other considerations: online lyric display and keyword search.
Your brief outline below did not mention these, but trademark enforcement for keyword search becomes a consideration, particularly in relation to Amazon's predatory online marketplace.
I will be happy to discuss a licensing proposal for print lyric display and will trust that the context for my lyrics are as you represented, and not as a subtext or otherwise subversive implication for my work or reputation.
Or welcome to provide me with an English version of the manuscript, to determine for myself.
Any information or contact you can provide for the author's prior publishing representatives is also appreciated.
Kind regards,
Michelle Shocked

Dear Michelle,
Thank you so much for getting back to me so quickly!
I understand your concern if I’m the first editor to ask to license your lyrics – the book was indeed first printed in Norwegian, then in the US, I believe. I haven’t been in touch with those editors, but I’m sure you can find the information online.
As for the respect of your lyrics, you may be certain that we are quoting them verbatim, the five lines I mentioned, not as a subtext but as a text per se – here is the passage in full (I’m adding my translation into English, in purple) :

Tous les jours, je passais à côté du musée Anne-Frank et de l’église qui se dresse à côté. Les cloches sonnaient tous les quarts d’heure. J’écoutais en boucle ≪ 5 A.M. in Amsterdam ≫ de Michelle Shocked, issue de son album intitulé The Texas Campfire Tapes. (Every day, I would walk past the Anne Frank museum and the church that stands next to it. The bells chimed every fifteen minutes. I listened to “5 A.M. in Amsterdam” by Michelle Shocked, from her album The Texas Campfire Tapes, again and again.)

It’s 5 a.m. in Amsterdam
And this is how I know
There’s a church beside a park
And it fills the dying dark
With five strokes
There it is again

Je ne connais aucune autre chanson qui colle mieux à cette ville, et je la trouve toujours aussi romantique. Quinze ans se sont écoulés depuis mon séjour, mais ces paroles suffisent à me renvoyer là-bas. Même si je n’ai jamais été aussi seul que cet automne-là, j’ai besoin d’entendre régulièrement sa mélodie, sa voix. (No song that I know fits the city better than this one, which always seems so romantic to me. Fifteen years have passed since my stay, yet those words are enough to take me back. Even though I’ve never been so lonely as I was that fall, I need to hear her melody, her voice, regularly).

I really think it’s a lovely tribute to your work and this specific song. That’s why we wanted to keep it in our edition, but I know license has to be asked in order to do so. We typically pay around $60 to be given permission to quote from a song or book, and my editor in chief is more than willing to do for your lyrics.
I hope we can work this out together, be assured that we are no Amazon (the mere name makes my teeth itch), just a small publishing house keen on respecting artists’ rights and proud to represent our own authors.
Yours,
Léa

Dear Lea
I realize you work under deadlines, so please give me a time frame that you would like this license request resolved by.
Meanwhile, I have reached out to Pushkin Press and hope to hear from them.
In case it's of interest, I will be on tour in France Oct 15-31, primarily based around Lyon.*
Also, I would gladly consider collaborating with your own marketing efforts for the French release, either with social media or live events, as well as available for media opportunities related to 5 AM. in Amsterdam.

Thanks for considering our deadlines, it is always a bit tight, and editing the translation into French has kept me too busy to be looking into licensing matters, which my colleague was supposed to handle. Ideally, if you could make a proposal by next Tuesday, it would be great. Our legal adviser said that if we couldn’t settle on a license we’d just have to give up on the quote, but it’s such a nice tribute, I think it’d be a shame.
Thanks for sharing the concert dates, I’ll definitely be on the lookout, Lyon is close to my hometown!
All best,
Léa

Hi Lea
I have your deadline on my mind, but I am still awaiting a response from Adam at Pushkin Press. I have an instinct that his response will inform my response to you. I promise to keep you notified, and I will send Adam another follow up email this evening.
Thanks for your patience,
Michelle

Dear Michelle,
Thank you for your message, I understand. From what I know on our end in France, we must ask for permission because there is no equivalent of “Fair Use”, as in the States, which makes it possible to quote a few lines as in this case.
I will keep the edited translation on hold to see whether we keep the quote from “5 A.M. in Amsterdam” or not.
All best,
Léa

I’ve been away until today. I passed this to my colleague Laura Macaulay who was the acquiring editor for the book and our assistant editor Kirsten Chapman.  I’m sure they’ll get on this.

In conclusion, I am certain the two facts are related, but how does one explain or prove this in a tribunal if the judges are not familiar with facts on the ground as they are happening in real time to songwriters left to protect themselves against the vicissitudes of predatory AI technology while these same DSPs are protected by DMCA safe harbors? However, I offer this additional information in good faith to help you understand the facts of my claim against Jincheng Zhang.

I don't consider this YouTube channel, ""Unknown or Deleted Music from YouTube!! ♪"" to be much different than that of Jincheng Zhang's scam, but they created this explainer titled:

""Who is Jincheng Zhang helps you find the real music title?""

Welcome to my channel, here I dedicate myself to uploading all the content removed from the record label: (Cardinal Sounds)","The market failure for licensing my copyrighted works: for lyric display, mechanical licenses, derivative works, reputational harm, clear chain of title etc. And because this is AI-generated, I will be buried in an avalanche of similar counterclaims and unable to address the demands for relief that I am due."

The developer references the ""English Pashto Qamoos” book for misrepresentation. The referenced book does not have the content I referenced as an example in the ""Supporting Document 2"" file. I can come up with 1000s other examples that prove the use of our data.

2) The developer says ""different Technology, Design, Logo, and Icons and Our app has more functionality the any other “Pashto Dictionary”.""

The developer does not have a good understanding of DMCA. I have explained that the claim is not about the nature of the app, design, functionality/ behaviour, logo, colour and etc, but the developer tries to justify these things.

I would like to emphasize that the developer of the ""Qamoos Dictionary"" does not claim ownership of the data. In the above statements and emails we have had, the developer tries to justify the fair use of data.","I published the ""Pashto Dictionary"" in 2012 with original content, and the ""Qamoos Dictionary"" that uses our data was recently published. I have been investing my money and time since 2012 to improve the application. The developer caused us financial damage as I have Google Ads on my application to generate revenue. I reinvest the income generated to improve the app. Since the ""Infringed app"" published, the number of users using our application decreased which resulted in decreased revenue as well. 

The developer resides in Afghanistan and knows that no authority can hold them liable financially for using copyright data therefore they have submitted a false counter-notification notice. I want the developer to remove our copyright data from their application. Until that, I request Google to avoid reinstating the application."

23-CCB-0106,Tarens v. Hottenstine,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/2343,"David Hottenstine has attempted to take down the band White Fuzzy Bloodbath's (""WFB"") copyrighted music in bad faith by filing false
DMCA Notices in violation of 17 U.S.C. § 512(f).  

First, David has sent multiple DMCA notices in bad faith, starting on or around March 23, 2021. Specifically, he has sent notifications to third-party websites such as YouTube and Bandcamp in attempts to have WFB’s content removed from those websites, despite the fact that
the content is, at a minimum, jointly authored and owned by Ms. Tarens. The Copyright Act of 1976 defines a joint work as “a work prepared by two or more authors with the intention that their contributions be merged into inseparable or interdependent parts of a unitary whole.” 17 U.S.C. §
101. Joint ownership occurs when a copyright is owned in undivided share by more than one person. Joint ownership may occur in many circumstances, including if the work is a product of joint authorship. 1 Melville B. Nimmer & David Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright § 6A.07 (rev. ed. 2022). Absent a written agreement otherwise, the authors of a joint work jointly own the copyright in each other’s contributions and each author owns an undivided interest in the copyright for the work as a whole. 17 U.S.C. § 201(a).

The Copyright Office records provide a clear answer of the authors of the songs contained in WFB’s Sugar & Rock album. Elise Tarens, Andreas Tsampoukos, and David Hottenstine are listed as the authors under copyright registration PA0002286134 for Works Published on the
Album Sugar & Rock. See also 17 U.S.C. § 410(c) (registration within five years of publication is prima facie evidence of the facts stated in the registration). Joint authorship entitles Ms. Tarens to “the independent right to use or license the copyright subject only to a duty to account for any
profits he earns from the licensing or use of the copyright.” Ashton-Tate Corp. v. Ross, 916 F.2d 516 (9th Cir. 1990); See also 17 U.S.C. § 201(a); Thomson v. Larson, 147 F.3d 195, 199 (2d Cir. 1998); Community for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid, 846 F.2d 1485, 1498 (D.C. Cir. 1988), aff’d, 490 U.S. 730 (1989) (“Joint authors co-owning copyright in a work are deemed to be tenants in common, with each having an independent right to use or license the copyright, subject only to a duty to account to the other co-owner for any profits earned thereby.”). Accordingly, a joint
copyright owner may not exclude other joint owners or persons who have a license from another joint owner, and cannot sue another joint owner for infringement. Ms. Tarens has accounted for and sent to David Hottenstine his share of royalties with each use of the music. Whether or not
he chose to accept the payments – and he refunded the last two amounts of $19.83 on or around March 17, 2021, and $16.30 on or around August 4, 2021 – Ms. Tarens has satisfied her obligations to him under the Copyright Act. David Hottenstine has no rights, under operation of law or
otherwise, to enjoin Ms. Tarens from granting nonexclusive licenses to WFB’s music that she is a joint author of. This is the reason why each of Ms. Tarens’ counter-notices have been successful in reinstating WFB’s music online. 

David Hottenstine has asserted several bad faith DMCA claims under
knowledge of the above facts, knowing that the content does not infringe any copyright laws or rights.","Ms. Tarens has had rightfully-owned content taken down several times, interfering with her potential business opportunities. This has led to many missed and/or lost opportunities. Ms. Tarens is seeking damages, to the extent permitted by law, for David Hottenstine's conduct in bad faith."

Based on that, specified facts are basis for consideration of misrepresentation of moshennik.eu and Viktor Dobroserdov as its representative.","As a self-employed person - journalist and analyst on a freelance, my articles are my only source of income, and the specialty and uniqueness of my work help me to support myself. So, the use of my intellectual property (my articles) without my permission deprives me of my means of livelihood.
Based on that, I kindly ask you to oblige the resource moshennik.eu and online service provider Google.com to remove my articles from the website moshennik.eu and Google search results."

DMG Media,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/2223,"The ""Selfie of Max Sebrechts"" copyrighted selfie picture has been shared by Jazmyn Jones who didn't get permission to do so. The incident was personal and entirely irrelevant to the rigging claims, which already have been proven to be false. The picture was shared by Jazmyn to Heather Lee O'Keefe, who contacted Ben Ashford and falsely used the works to support her false claim of rigging.","I was forced to step down from the organization, while none of these messages referred to had anything to do with my role at Miss USA. The suspension has been released in the meantime, but the article from DailyMail and all other online service providers copying Mr. Ashford's article. resulted in a solid harm suffered by not only Max Sebrechts, but his family and larger network. The article misrepresents Max Sebrechts and his photographic work ""Selfie of Max Sebrechts"" and therefore must be taken down. The publication by Online Service Provider was used purely with the objective of pursuing commercial gain and gain social attention, it breaches US copyright law and was not subject to any agreement between the parties."

I received no subpoena and I am an American Citizen which is outside of Philippine Jurisdiction. Roann Celis-Capistrano and her lawyer alleged that I made misrepresentations to You Tube, I explained why my video is fair use and Youtube accepted my explanation and that is not misrepresentation. Roann Celis-Capistrano and her lawyer alleged that I unjustly enriched myself among 
other things, obtaining profits, depriving Plaintiff of the compensation to 
which she is rightly entitled, and taking credit for Plaintiff’s original work. I do not sell anything, my videos are for public service and I only made $51 on the said video. Once my expenses are deducted such as internet, electricity, subscriptions and time, no profits were made from my Youtube channel.

Now our monthly sales have dropped to about 7000USD per month.
2. Double the cost of promotion. Due to the increased competition, our advertising expenses have also increased a lot. Before, the monthly advertising cost was about 600 US dollars per month, and now it costs about 1100 US dollars per month per month.

Explanation: I was the 4-th significant contributor to this manuscript right after Pierre Hausfater, Liliana Tejidor, and Neus Robert Boter. The rest of the authors are gifted authors. I also contributed to the initial draft of the manuscript, which was completed by the end of July 2020. But my name was removed from the publication.

Explanation: I was the only person who knew and could use this software called SAS. This is a very specialized programming software only statisticians generally use. None of the Authors of this manuscript has expertise in SAS. But they claimed they used the SAS and conducted the data analysis.

3)	Lie: Data analysis was completed by PH, LT, LV, MC, CM, and NRB
Explanation: Again, I am the only one who conducted all data analyses using the software SAS. I produced every table and figure. None of the authors has minimal statistical expertise to conduct this level of analyses. But they claimed that they did the data analysis.

4)	Misrepresentation: The authors are also grateful to the following Beckman Coulter employees Mohamad Hasan and Gang Xu, for statistical support.
Explanation: I should be an author by ICMJE (International Committee of Medical Journal Editor) guidelines but I was removed from the authorship.","I am a young researcher. Every publication is very significant for my career growth, reputation, and job salary. Because of this unethical work, I cannot claim I am the manuscript's author, although I have made a significant contribution. Without my work, the manuscript could not have anything to write on. This is one of the works that I have done to be proud of. However, by plagiarism and by falsely calming my work to these authors’ work, they secured funds, whereas I can not. The company Beckman Coulter also secured profit from this publication and business relations with BARDA (Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority).  In contrast, I have been going through so much stress and wasting my valuable time, which is approximately 400 hours, till today. I could use the same time for my career growth, consultancy, securing research funds, and also for publications.

I would like to see my authorship in this manuscript and appropriate credit for my work.  Also, I am compensated for the time I had to spend to resolve the dispute and for the added stress these authors and the institutions added to my daily life."

I take great pride in my 5-star reviews, providing personal customer service and high quality products to my loyal patrons. Aside from lost revenue, by reproducing and profiting off of poor quality reproductions of my copyrighted artwork, the Respondent is harming my reputation as a graphics artist and small business.

The recipe posted by Jamie Park is a copy of my recipe, in which the serving size has been modified to cover up this attempt. In the photo I will be providing, I have adjusted the serving size from 4 to 5, and the ingredient measurements are relatively the same, with the same exact cooking method. 

Moreover, in the original report I have submitted a screenshot that shows that Jamie Park has been modifying her recipe ratings to surpass my organic ratings, and this still stands valid today. On the day of the report, the number of ratings on cookerru.com was higher than drivemehungry.com. Although Jamie Park's post was taken down in the Google search results for nearly two weeks after the DMCA report was approved by Google on August 7th, the current number of 5-star ratings is 358, compared to 320 on cookerru.com, which is ranking currently at #1 for high-volume keywords and has an estimated traffic of 38,515, as per Keysearch. In comparison, the post published by Jamie Park has an estimated traffic of 4,047 despite the post showing a higher number of ratings than my original post. I will also be submitting this evidence in the documentation section.","Under the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act, I am requesting that Jamie Park's post continues to be removed from the Google search results, as the post contains material that was taken from my original post that took an immense amount of time and effort to share to my audience. Moreover, submitting the original DMCA report as well as this follow-up report has been extremely time-consuming in an effort to showcase proper objective evidence, and has taken away from the time I could have spent on my business and has in turn affected my overall revenue. I believe all creative work should be protected under the Copyright Law to protect the author's integrity and the amount of hard work and effort dedicated to creating each original post."
22-CCB-0095,Barabanov v. Богачев,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/291,"The sender of the counter-notice considered himself the author of my articles. 

Along with that, articles on the website ekonomnews.ru were created and posted in 2019, much earlier than articles posted on komentish.com. (see relevant dates on the website).

Based on that, specified facts are the basis for consideration of misrepresentation of komentish.com and Виталий Богачев (Vitalli Bogachiev) as its representative.","As a self-employed person - journalist and analyst on a freelance, my articles are my only source of income, and the specialty and uniqueness of my work help me to support myself. So, the use of my intellectual property (my articles) without my permission deprives me of my means of livelihood. 

Based on that, I kindly ask you to oblige the resource komentish.com and online service provider Google.com to remove my articles from the website komentish.com and Google search results."

22-CCB-0035,Flores v. Mitrakos,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/72,"""I have a database of ""facts"" and hand picked images for hundreds of locations around the world. This extension stole all of that data, every single one of my images and every single ""fact"" letter for letter."" Respondent claims he is the ""owner"" of this ""factual"" data, and that the images he is also the owner of. In fact, the factual data was scraped by both of us over a period of time in 2021and 2022 and put into a database. When we determined that we should end our working relationship, I asserted my authorship claim over the content being taken down, and in writing he said ""I give you permission to take the API codebase to recreate heroku"" (Heroku is a provider of database and other services). I proceeded to do that. Now here he claims this infringed his copyright, when in fact this is merely a retaliatory claim due to my filing a DMCA claim based on his appropriation of my design and copyright computer code expressions on multiple occasions without written or verbal permission.","As a result of this, the content is not available to users attempting to reach it. Due to marketing and other outreach efforts which cost hundreds of dollars per month to send interested users to the content (via the website https://passportapp.io and directly to the Chrome Web Store, where it is unavailable), this is resulting in active monetary harm. The relief I seek is for the claim to be withdrawn, and for the respondent to cease filing takedown notices with false statements."
22-CCB-0030,Wild v. Calkin,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/67,"""I have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentiﬁcation of the material to be removed or disabled."" 

The above statement statement is false. Deborah Calkin is neither an authorized agent of Source Vibrations music, nor a copyright owner, collaborator or otherwise legally entitled to speak or act on behalf of my creative works. The TuneCore account in which this content is hosted has been captured and defrauded.","Actual Damages and Profits: It is estimated by the use of Spotify streaming revenue calculators, in conjunction with information obtained via the spotify for artists website that the infringing party has taken roughly $40,000 in Spotify streaming royalties for Solfeggio Harmonics Vol.1 alone. Specific amounts prior to an injunction into the account’s records are not available, but could be much higher depending on the duration and degree of the offense. Royalties from Amazon, Pandora and other streaming services as well as digital downloads from iTunes and other digital download stores are only visible through the TuneCore account records. 

Statutory Damages: The infringing party has interfered with the publication, distribution and accounting mechanisms of Source Vibrations music by defrauding the account (TuneCore) under the email: fogleolina33@gmail.com. It's my belief that the infringing party altered the original account email, willfully falsified copyright ownership information within the TuneCore account and in statements made directly to TuneCore copyright agents in order to unscrupulously withdraw royalties. This has caused significant distress and financial hardship on me [the copyright owner], limiting my ability to conduct the business of promoting the infringed upon works and publishing additional works through this platform. 

Given the nature of the offense it is impractical to put a value on this hardship. Pursuant to title 17 of U.S. Code § 504, in the case where I [the copyright owner] “sustains the burden of proving, and the court finds, that infringement was committed willfully, the court in its discretion may increase the award of statutory damages to a sum of $150,000.” The copyright owner will therefore seek the maximum relief for statutory damages in the event an injunction to prevent further infringing activity, or to gain access to the financial records and to the account in question is challenged in such a way as to require the copyright owner to accrue further legal fees. 

I [the copyright owner] am seeking relief in the following ways:  

1. A court order to restrain the infringing party from engaging in infringing activity. 2. I am seeking to gain access to the account and its financial records. 3. I am seeking damages in the amount of $30,000"
22-CCB-0023,Jaramillo v. Apple Inc.,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/54,They did not study my case. The actually ignore my first notification and I have to send a second notification. The simply ignored because the people who is making money from my work (which is not real information about them) don't want to take the material off and they denied my claim. I can take this individuos to court because I don't have any information about them,"This is cost me monetary lost, this material was confidential and academic. it is affecting my academic work and reputation. It is related academic work with Colombian drug cartels. I don't even know if my work is using for laundry money from drug cartel"
22-CCB-0021,Jaramillo v. YouTube,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/52,"YouTube ignored the Colombian Fiscalia report and I wrote them that the information of the counter notification was a fraud, it was fake. One of them refer to another work was done one year before for a film  (they also don't have the copyright for it) and the other registration the company confirmed me that the number was fake.","My academic work has damage, it has missleding my work. This work was confidential and it was for academic work. I am also worry that it may be used in laundry money from a Colombian drug cartel and who knows what else to organize crime and prostitution. My academic career has been serious damage and my finances because I had been under so much stress from the death threats from this drug cartel."
22-CCB-0020,Wright v. Potter,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/50,"Respondent swore under penalty of perjury that he had a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled by mistake or because of mis-identification of the material.

There was no misidentification of material as claimant's counsel is acutely aware of claimant's artwork and that the infringing listing by respondent was not authorized by claimant. Similarly, there was no mistake in removing the infringing content. Upon information and belief, respondent received an email from a third party seller on Etsy informing respondent to not use/resell the infringing design contained in the listing. 

Upon information and belief, respondent knowingly provided false and/or inaccurate information in the Counter-Notice for sole purpose of misleading claimant and Etsy so as to avoid liability from Plaintiff’s lawful claims, as well as to avoid termination of its ability to use Etsy’s services. Etsy maintains a repeat infringer policy and also has the ability to limit access to funds when an account owner is accused of infringement.","As a result of the misrepresentation, claimant has suffered specific harm in the form of attorney's fees and costs that it would not have incurred, but for the misrepresentation. Claimant is entitled to all damages associated with this matter, attorney’s fees, and any and all costs, as permitted by 17. U.S.C. §512(f)."
