23-CCB-0417,"Mystery Sheet LLC, et al v. Steffens",https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/6472,"A Youtube Channel called CriminaliTy uploaded a video on December 19, 2023 called ""The Delphi Murders | Drip by Drip: The Leak Unveils a Puddle as Spinsters Weave a Web of Tales."" That video discussed an episode of our podcast — ""The Delphi Murders: The Leak"" at length. Through much of the live video, the hosts had a transcript of our episode prominently displayed. We feel that violates fair use and infringes on our copyright, given that by compiling and displaying the transcript of our scripted episode throughout much of the live, CriminaliTy created a situation where viewers could easily forego listening to our episode. Instead, they could simply consume our episode through CriminaliTy's illicit transcript. The video was removed by Youtube, but CriminaliTy has inexplicably contested the removal. So we no longer have access to images or video from CriminaliTy's original live video.",We are independent creators. When Youtubers like CriminaliTy steal our content — whether they are creating and displaying illicit transcripts or playing long swaths of our shows— then viewers may go to them rather than listening to our program. This undermines our work. We consider CriminaliTy's decision to post a transcript of our script without our permission a serious breach of our copyright and an attack on our business.

23-CCB-0413,Daugherty v. Griffin,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/6419,"The respondent obtained a copy of the video, which had been electronically transmitted to an individual, through an illicit agreement. This video was then used to create a clickbait ""gotcha"" moment on YouTube, aimed at generating profit. The claimant, upon noticing this misuse, filed a copyright notification with YouTube, leading to the video's removal. However, the respondent, in violation of YouTube's terms of service, edited the video by adding titles and re-uploaded it to the same YouTube channel. The claimant was compelled to file another copyright violation notification with YouTube, resulting in the video being removed again.

Despite not having any legal rights to the video, the respondent filed counter-notifications for both instances of its use. Furthermore, the respondent uploaded this illegally acquired video to her TikTok account, where it is still live. Both the YouTube and TikTok accounts are monetized, enabling the respondent to profit from the usage of this copyrighted material.","Harm Suffered:
1. Infringement of Copyrighted Work: The respondent obtained a copy of the video, initially transmitted electronically to an individual, and used it to create a clickbait moment on YouTube for profit. This act constitutes a direct infringement of the claimant's copyrighted work.

2 Unlawful Reposting and Editing: Despite initial removal by YouTube, the respondent violated YouTube's terms of service by overlaying titles on the video and re-uploading it to the same channel, further infringing the claimant's copyright.


3. Profit from Infringement: The respondent has used the illegally obtained video on monetized YouTube and TikTok accounts, thus profiting from the copyrighted material without any rights assigned to them.

Relief Sought:
1. Statutory Damages: Given that the copyright registration was sought within three months of publishing, the claimant is eligible for statutory damages of $30,000.

2. Recovery of Infringer’s Profits: The claimant seeks to recover profits made by the respondent from the infringing activity."

As an individual who takes great pride in my work and the originality of my creations, I am deeply concerned about this matter.  

As the owner, originator, creator, and designer of certain proprietary trade secrets, the Copyright Act provides protection for original works of authorship, including software code, computer programs, databases, and digital content. The Patent Act grants inventors exclusive rights to their inventions and covers technological innovations, processes, machines, compositions of matter, and design patents. 

I, Jesseca Hussain, Ar., did not grant the exclusive rights to make, use, sell, or import my invention or any derivative thereof for any limited period or extended period to the Apple Inc. Thusly, Apple Inc. is prohibited from using the patented invention without the my permission. 

The specific intellectual properties in question are the industrial design, trade secrets, and but not limited to the properties in detail, including any relevant patents or copyrights associated with the Apple Watch. These intellectual properties have been duly registered and protected under the applicable laws and regulations governing intellectual property rights.","There have been several negative consequences and causes of various forms of suffering that I have endured since the copyright infringement of my product occurred:

1. Emotional distress: I have experienced a range of negative emotions, such as frustration, anger, betrayal, and a sense of violation. Seeing someone else take credit or benefit from my ideas has been deeply hurtful and demoralizing.

2. Financial loss: My stolen idea had commercial value and the potential for financial gain, as the original creator I have suffered financial losses. I have missed out on opportunities for monetizing my idea or I lost market share to the company/person who stole my idea.

3. Professional setbacks: Idea theft has negatively impacted my professional reputation and opportunities. It has undermined my credibility, making it harder for me to gain recognition or secure future collaborations or employment.

4. Stifled innovation: I have been discouraged from sharing my ideas and has lead to a broader chilling effect on innovation, as I have become reluctant to disclose my ideas due to fear of theft.

5. Legal battles: Legal battles can be time-consuming, stressful, and expensive and this will further prolong the suffering I have experienced by the thief."

23-CCB-0404,"Braun IP Law, LLC v. Marston, et al",https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/6224,"Lily Marston (“Respondent Marston”) and Jessica Vazquez (“Respondent Vazquez”), collectively referred to as ""Respondents,"" published a video on December 2, 2023, on YouTube, known as episode 97 and titled “Lauren the Mortician’s Lawyer is WAY WORSE than We Thought + VLOG SQUAD: Where Are They Now?” (“Infringing Work”).   Respondents copied a substantial portion of Braun IP Law, LLC’s (“Claimant”) copyright registered work titled ""Bekah Day False Accusations,"" Registration No. PA 2-443-504, issued on December 5, 2023. The infringement started on December 2, 2023, and continues through multiple online platforms. The infringement on YouTube ceased on December 8, 2023. The Infringing Work was viewed more than 132,000 times before it was removed from YouTube. Respondents were not given authorization, license, or permission to use any portion of Claimant’s work by Claimant.  Respondents have admitted, by claiming fair use under penalty of perjury in their counter-notices submitted to YouTube, that: 1) Claimant has a valid copyright to its work; 2) Respondents copied Claimant’s work; 3) Respondents used at least a portion of the work in their video; and 3) Respondents did not have authorization to use the work. 

1. Introduction

Respondents are owners of the Do We Know Them podcast, typically published as a video on YouTube first and then republished as audio only on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Castbox, RSS, Pocket Casts, Overcast, Bullhorn, Castro, Player FM, Podcast Addict, Podbean, Podhero, Podcast Guru, Podcast Republic, Podfriend, RadioPublic, Sonnet, and Subscribe on Android.  The list of dissemination platforms can be found at this link https://tr.ee/eWrAH6zvPM.  Respondents have about 95,800 subscribers on YouTube.  Claimant does not know the number of subscribers for each of the podcast republication platforms listed above at this time.

Respondents proclaim purpose of their podcast is to “discuss the latest in internet news & drama - involving everyone from people we know, to people we've never heard of before...” and they have a “unique perspective” on internet drama.  See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXo5y_SY3Zk. In the majority of their videos, they use content owned by the creators/people who they created their video about.  Upon information and belief, Respondents do not own or have a license to use the majority of the works they take from others.  Upon information and belief, Respondents have never hired photographers to photograph or film the people who they create their videos about and have never purchased a copyright to the works they include in their videos.  

2. Fair Use Legal Standard

There is no presumption of fair use. See Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569, 581 (1994) (“Like a book review quoting the copyrighted material criticized, parody may or may not be fair use, and petitioners' suggestion that any parodic use is presumptively fair has no more justification in law or fact than the equally hopeful claim that any use for news reporting should be presumed fair, see Harper Row, 471 U.S., at 561.”).  The U.S. Supreme Court reaffirmed this holding in Andy Warhol Found. For the Visual Arts v. GoldSmith, 143 S. Ct. 1258, 1276 n.7 (2023) (“ But again, the question of justification will depend on the individual use or uses. See Patry, Fair Use § 3:1, at 129-130. Even book reviews are not entitled to a presumption of fairness. Campbell, 510 U.S. at 581, 114 S.Ct. 1164.”). “[F]air use has been defined as the ""privilege in others than the owner of a copyright to use the copyrighted material in a reasonable manner without his consent."" Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. V. Nation Enterprises, 471 U.S. 539, at 549 (quoting H. Ball, Law of Copyright and Literary Property, 260 (1944)).” Acuff-Rose Music, Inc. v. Campbell, 754 F. Supp. 1150, 1153 (M.D. Tenn. 1991).  Fair use is an affirmative defense. Harper Row, 471 U.S. at 561. Fair use must be determined on a case by case basis by a judiciary. Warhol, 143 S. Ct. at 1262 (“The factors ""set forth general principles, the application of which requires judicial balancing, depending upon relevant circumstances."" Google LLC v. Oracle America, Inc., 593 U. S. —, —, 141 S.Ct. 1183, 209 L.Ed.2d 311.”).”  The burden of proving fair use falls on the defendant. Monge v. Maya Magazines, Inc., 688 F.3d 1164, 1170 (9th Cir. 2012) (“As with all affirmative defenses, Maya as the defendant bears the burden of proof. See Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters., 471 U.S. 539, 561, 105 S.Ct. 2218, 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985).”).

3. Description of Infringement
On December 2, 2023, Respondents, without Claimant’s permission or authorization, copied over one minute of Claimant’s copyright registered video titled ""Bekah Day False Accusations."" Respondents did not modify the substantial portion used, which can be found around 47:03 to 48:04 of their YouTube video originally published through this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWDqzt59xI4.  Upon information and belief, the sound for the video can be found within in a 10 minute or so window around the same time in all of the republications.  The time stamps change depending on how many ads are including in each of the republications. Respondents copied the heart of Claimant’s work reproduced it exactly as Claimant published the work.  Claimant published the work through this link: https://www.tiktok.com/@braunlaw/video/7306554494966336810.  The portion of Claimant’s work that was stolen can be found at 0:00 to about 1:01 Claimant’s work.  The portion taken is Respondents did not provide a link to Claimant’s original video in their video or podcast publications.  They have the ability to do so, and did so with other author’s works.  See the attached screenshot of Respondent’s Description of their video showing a link to Bekah Day’s video, which they included in their video identified above.  Respondents have departed from their usual practice of linking the works they take in their publications by not linking Claimant’s work. The portion taken constitutes the heart of Claimant’s creative work. Claimant did not post its video on YouTube and no license to use the work was given to Respondents by YouTube as part of YouTube’s terms of service.

4. DMCA Takedown Request
Claimant submitted a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) takedown request to YouTube on December 7, 2023, via email, which was approved by the platform on December 8, 2023. See the attached email from Claimant to YouTube comprising the request. 

5. Monetization and Commercial Use
The Respondents' YouTube channel was monetized, and the use of Claimant’s work of authorship was for commercial gain. When a person uploads a video to YouTube, the uploaded video has to be manually marked by the uploader to be monetized.  Upon information and belief, Respondents marked their video to enable the display of ads during playback, knowing that YouTube compensates monetized channels based on the number of views. Upon information and belief, the publication of the podcast audio on ever one of the platforms identified above is also monetized.  Claimant listened to a majority of the audio podcasts and heard ads being played in each one it listened to.  

6. Counternotice and Fair Use Claim
On or about December 10, 2023, both Respondents separately filed DMCA counternotices, each of which claimed fair use. Attached are copies of the counternotices. Each counternotice lacks specificity on how the use is transformative. Each merely states that it is so. By claiming fair use, Respondents have admitted, under penalty of perjury, that: 1) Claimant has a valid copyright to its work; 2) Respondents copied Claimant’s work; 3) Respondents used at least a portion of the work in their video; and 3) Respondents did not have authorization to use the work.  Claimant is reserving its arguments against their fair use claim until after Respondents have filed their answer and have pled with particularity how their use in the Infringing Work is transformative.

7. Ownership of Copyright
Claimant is the owner of the copyright to ""Bekah Day False Accusations,"" as evidenced by Copyright Certificate of Registration No. PA 2-443-504 (unofficial copy attached).

8. Unlawful Copying from TikTok
Respondents obtained the copyrighted work from Braun IP Law, LLC's TikTok page, where the download function is disabled. Respondents had to copy Claimant’s video by screen recording or use of software to rip the video from the TikTok platform. Claimant’s is the owner of its TikTok page and its TikTok page is classified as a business page in the platform.

9. Good Faith Takedown
While the decision is Lenz v. Universal Music Corp., 801 F.3d 1126 (9th Cir. 2015) is not binding in Claimant’s jurisdiction, Claimant did comply with the ruling and performed a fair use analysis prior to submitting its DMCA takedown.  The U.S. Supreme Court has not ruled on the issue of whether a copyright owner needs to perform a fair use analysis prior to submitting a DMCA takedown as of today.

10. Conclusion
Respondents have admitted to copying Claimant’s work of authorship without permission and using it in their video that was disseminated to at least 18 other platforms, each of which pays Respondents based on the amount of views/plays.  Upon information and belief, Respondents' use of Braun IP Law, LLC's work is not fair use and is likely to fail on all factors.","Claimant is seeking the maximum relief that the Board believes is justified. Claimant's copyright was registered within three months of the publication date and statutory damages are available to Claimant. Respondents appear to have infringed Claimant's copyright at least 19 times. In Elvis Presley Enters., Inc. v. Passport Video, 349 F.3d 622 (9th Cir. 2003), the court noted that because the use was commercial in nature, market harm could be presumed. The market for licensing television clips would be undermined with widespread use of this type. Claimant suffers similar damages as Evlis Presley Enters. because the use is commercial in nature and the market for Claimant's original video is being undermined by the widespread dissemination of the Infringing Work. Respondents did not include a link to Claimant's original work and appear to be purposefully driving views away from Claimant's original publication. The market of viewers of Respondents' infringing work are the same as Claimant's original work: those that are interested in learning about the subject matter of Claimant's work. Claimant's TikTok account, where the original work was published, is a business account and nearly all videos are published by Claimant to make a profit. Claimant and Respondent appear to be in the same business sector with their content: publishing about content creator issues."
23-CCB-0403,Johnson v. 300 ENT,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/6220,"Gunna has used and is continuing to use my signature sound ""ha ha ha ha"" (breath chants of the word HOT) in songs titled HOT ft Young Thug, and song "" FUCKUMEAN"". He's used my sound and is portraying it as his own original creation. I let the first offense slide in 2019 because I thought they were paying me their respects, but he's done it again in 2023 with song ""FUCKUMEAN"". So I see he's trying to portray it as his own intellectual property and will continue to do so if I don't stop it now.","I have not received any royalties, acknowledgement/credits nor been listed as a contributing author on said songs."

23-CCB-0400,"Joe Hand Promotions, Inc. v. G & P Inc., et al",https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/6179,"Claimant Joe Hand Promotions, Inc. (""Claimant"") is a Pennsylvania corporation that specializes in commercially licensing premier sporting events to commercial locations such as bars, restaurants, lounges, clubhouses and similar establishments. 

By written agreement, Claimant was granted the exclusive right to license, display, and distribute publicly [17 U.S.C. § 106(4) & (5)] the following Ultimate Fighting Championship® (""UFC"") and boxing programs, including all undercard bouts and commentary, for businesses such as the business made the basis of this claim: 

UFC 257: Dustin Poirier vs. Conor McGregor 2 on January 23, 2021,
UFC 264: Dustin Poirier vs. Conor McGregor 3 on July 10, 2021,
UFC 265: Derrick Lewis vs. Ciryl Gane on August 7, 2021,
UFC 266: Alexander Volkanovski vs. Rafael Ortega on September 25, 2021,
Tyson Fury vs. Deontay Wilder III on October 9, 2021,
UFC 268: Kamaru Usman vs. Colby Covington 2 on November 6, 2021,
UFC 269: Charles Oliviera vs. Dustin Poirier on December 11, 2021, and
Jake Paul vs. Tyron Woodley II on December 18, 2021,

(the ""Programs""). Commercial businesses such as the business made the basis of this claim were not authorized to receive and exhibit any of the Programs in their commercial business without authorization from Claimant.

Respondents G & P Inc. and George Pitsilionis (collectively the ""Respondents"") owned, operated, maintained, and controlled the commercial business known as White Moose located at 513 Main Street, Kenai, AK 99611 (the “Establishment”) on the dates of the Programs.

Respondent George Pitsilionis (“Respondent Pitsilionis”) is an individual who resides in the State of Alaska.  On the dates of the Programs, Respondent Pitsilionis was the sole owner, officer, and Director, President, Shareholder, Secretary, Treasurer, and Vice President of G & P Inc., an entity formed to operate a Drinking Place.  By virtue of his position(s) as it relates to the Establishment, Respondent Pitsilionis had a right and ability to supervise the activities of the Establishment on the dates of the Programs and had an obvious and direct financial interest in the activities of the Establishment on the dates of the Programs.

Prior to the broadcasts of the Programs, Respondents could have contracted with Claimant and purchased authorization to exhibit each of the Programs in the Establishment for a fee.  However, Respondents chose not to contract with Claimant or pay any of the fees to Claimant to obtain the proper license or authorization. At no time did Claimant give Respondents license, permission or authority to receive and exhibit any of the Programs in the Establishment.

Instead, Respondents, including their agents, servants, and/or employees, took affirmative steps to circumvent the commercial licensing requirement and unlawfully obtained the Programs and exhibited them in their Establishment. 
 
Upon information and belief, Respondents willfully engaged in illegal acts to receive each of the Programs for free or at nominal cost while Claimant’s legitimate customers paid several thousand dollars.  Respondents knew, or should have known, their receipt and exhibition of the Programs at their establishment were not authorized.

Upon information and belief, Respondents intentionally pirated the Programs for the sole purpose of their own economic gain. Respondents exhibited the Programs for the commercial purpose of attracting paying customers, patrons, members, and guests, thereby wrongfully benefiting financially by infringing Claimant’s rights in the Programs.

Respondents did not have license, authorization, permission, or consent from Claimant to exhibit any of the Programs in the Establishment.

As exclusive licensee of each of the Programs, Claimant has standing and capacity to bring this action in its own name against Respondents for their violation of the Copyright Act.

Respondents’ unauthorized display and public performance of each of the Programs through any means was in violation of 17 U.S.C. §§ 106 and 501.

Respondents’ acts of infringement were not only willful, intentional, and purposeful, but also in complete disregard of and indifference to Claimant’s rights.

Accordingly, Claimant is entitled to judgment in its favor and against each Respondent, jointly and severally, for statutory damages, in the discretion of the Board, plus interest, costs and attorneys’ fees.","Claimant seeks statutory damages in the discretion of the Board, of up to the maximum amount of $30,000.00 for the Respondents’ willful violations of 17 U.S.C. § 501 and for Claimant’s attorney’s fees, interest, and costs of proceedings."

I am seeking full statutory damages in an effort to preserve and protect my ability to license my works in a fair and open marketplace as a good faith and willing participant."
23-CCB-0398,"Brown v. Ithikatt, et al",https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/6076,"Red Letter Media stole my Film ""Diamond Cobra vs The White Fox"" including my original songs ""Love Ties"" and ""Ill Do Me"" as well as footage from my music video ""Love Ties"" all without my permission. Their video went viral on YouTube with over 1 million views, with their fans attacking my name, likeness, film, songs with lies due to this video. 

The video displayed the beginning, middle and ending of my film, a whole one hour video they made calling themselves Movie critics, a good 80% of my film was displayed in their video, along with defamation of character toward me. Their fans kept calling this ""Fair- Use"" saying its a review video. This was not a review video it was cyber bullying, a cheap way to steal my film and display it all over the internet just to gain money/views on YouTube by taking someone else work. Real ""fair-use"" content is less then 10% of copyrighted content including news reporters, real movie critics etc. 

These people are abusing the term ""fair-use"" to steal other people content and display it all over the internet which is sad. 

I also researched “fair-use” on google it said no more then 10% of a single movie or tv show may be used and as far as movie reviews it mentioned it can hardly be used as “fair-use” 

Anyhow the video was removed by my music distributor back in 2021 from Red Letter Media YouTube channel. However this same video keep being re uploaded by their fans, continuously on going harassment, cyber bullying, attacking me, slander, lies about me, my family and my film work by crazy obsessed fans, running to my social media, my film imdb, amazon page, reddit, blogs etc attacking me non stop all because of this one video. 

We are now in 2023 and they keep attacking me, the fans will not leave me or this video alone.  

Red Letter Media the original uploader has moved on, they are making new videos on other filmmaker, stealing their content and posting it on youtube. They let this one go after I sent them a DMCA takedown, even though they still have a Photoshop image of me on their official website using my likeliness without my permission. They are so determine to have my photo on their website which is sad they have to use me, my name, and likeness to gain attention.

Every time I report the re-uploads to Youtube, they remove it for copyright infringement however they allowed this one fan to 
counter-claim it calling it ""fair-use"" which is a lie, which I had already resolve this issue with Red Letter Media but the fans will not let this go. 

This fan Suraj Ithikatt has no legal right to the video or my content, I don't understand why Youtube would allow a false counter claim when they already know this same video keep getting reuploaded and they have a copy of all the copyright reports. 

Youtube said I have 10 days to file a court claim or CCB claim. Which I feel is ridiculous that they would even allow this to happen by a fan. 

People that are not associate with this video or my copyrighted content shouldn't insert themselves in the matter. However since this is non stop issue, I'm filing this claim with CCB.","I want YouTube to stop allowing re uploads of this same video, I hit prevent copies but it still keep being re uploaded since 2020-present. 
It had already been establish that is was not ""fair-use"" but this is on going harassment, cyber bullying, my film being displayed on the internet for free, I'm losing revenue on my film. People are believing the lies that was told about me and my film work all because of this video. This is stressful and annoying. No one deserves this type of abuse for being a filmmaker. I went to college got my BA Degree in film class of 2010. I'm aware that people might like the content I create which is fine, but no one has the right to go on a rampage of slandering my name for stealing my copyrighted content just to gain views and income out of it. I want this to STOP!!

Also, I can provide more email screenshots from Coverfly stating that my TV script was written in 2021 for the Nickleodeon Writing program. South Park was one of the accepted shows so people in the industry already had access to my TV script.  they also use the plot of using science to help push the story which is the same as in my script. Kenny is seen working in the lab, which is science, while in mines the boys work on a science project together. They also both use Japanese characters as a major character in the script as well. In South Park the return of Covid they start the show about going to Denver nuggets game which is the same premise for my script in when they start out at Colorado buffalos' game. So, they both start out with the premise of basketball players. In South Park post Covid and return of Covid they both use science and scientist to push the story, and, in my script, it was about the boys doing their science project. Their Japanese modeler is in both specials as my script features the Japanese teacher.

Respondent created a nearly exact copy of the work. They only modified the colors.
Respondent then posted the work in their own Etsy shop and claimed that it was theirs to sell.","In this copyright infringement case, the unauthorized posting of the original work for sale on Etsy has resulted in significant damages for the original creator. The act has directly led to a tangible financial loss as potential buyers, instead of purchasing the work through legitimate channels, may have opted for the infringing copy. This diversion of sales undermines the economic value of the original creation and deprives the rightful creator of the fair compensation they are entitled to. Furthermore, the presence of the unauthorized copy on Etsy introduces confusion among buyers, as they may struggle to distinguish between the authentic work and the illicit reproduction. This confusion not only compromises the integrity of the original creator's brand but also jeopardizes the trust of consumers who may inadvertently support copyright infringement. Consequently, the damages extend beyond mere financial loss, encompassing the erosion of the creator's market reputation and the disruption of a fair and competitive marketplace."

I am the only one who has the copyright of my interview with Popeye in 2018 and the full material which relates to this interview. This interview related to a PhD from the University of Edinburgh and this material was confidential. I don’t allow the distribution, public publicly perform and display, share, sell or any kind of alteration can make to my confidential work. Sebastian Lugo who filmed the interview doesn’t have any right to distribute, alter, publicly perform, share or use my work in any way. He had distributed, alter and copy my work and he had violated my exclusive right. He had made money with YouTube with my material. Sebastian Lugo has access to my work because he was paid to film and edit my interview. he had distributed this material with Natalia Duque in a few videos, which has a substantial similarity and it is a photomontage of my work. I want to clarify that there is no fair use or educational use because the interview is confidential and the YouTube channel Popeye Arrepetido and Nextark are not educational channels, rather these channels prompt satanism, violence and prostitution.
1. EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS
a. Copy of my work: Sebastian XIbille did not have any right to keep a copy of my work. He had copied part of my interview to publish a few video on YouTube with Juliana Duque. Some of these videos are http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEzHUU5cBo8. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M43sVVNfRHQ. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBI9qBmIM48

e. Publicly performance my work: Juliana Duque and Sebastian Xibille had edit my work and make a photomontage where Juliana Duque personated me and take the credit of my work.
YouTube and Google have violated my exclusive rights of my work because failed to remove or disable access to the material expeditiously upon the provision of such notice. They have ignored my copyright notification and fake information had displayed to maintain the material online and ignored my copyright notification, a proper takedown notice. Thus, google and YouTube had fraudulently Removed Copyright Notice, a proper takedown notice. As a result, my exclusive rights had been violated because the material has been copied, distributed, created derive work and display publicly my work. It has also prompt that new videos published with my work.
DESCRIPTION OF THE INFRINGEMENT (Juliana Duque and Sebastian Xibille)
Sebastian Lugo Xibille was appointed and paid for recording my interview of Popeye’s interview in 2010 May in Colombia. He was only paid for recorded the interview, which clearly shows that he does not have the copyrights of this video. He was appointed by JJK media and John Jairo Velasquez. I paid Velasquez for recording the interview and Sebastian Lugo was appointed by that company. the president of JJK Media and manager of John Jairo Velasquez, Pamela Igrao signed a paper where I have the copyright of my work and they are the owner of Velasquez's visual material. There is a contract between JJK media and Velasquez.
This interview was part of my PhD for the University of Edinburgh (UK) and it was confidential material. I was the editor of this interview and it was also my questions, which made it my creative material and make me the owner of the exclusive right because under Colombia law the editor is the owner and also in the case of PhD the student is the owner because the material is part of a thesis. I shall underline that the interview questions have been prepared by myself only. I also was the person who asked the question in the interview. I never gave permission to Sebastian Lugo and his partner, Juliana Duque to alter, use and make money from my creative material (questionary) and my video. I never gave them permission to use any of my Exclusive rights: copy of my work, distribute a copy of my work, create a derive of my work, publicly perform and publicly publish my work in YouTube and another platforms.
However, Sebatian and Juliana have used my work in two of his YouTube channel Popeye Arrepentido and Nextark without my permission. They have build an argument by pretending that the owner is the son of John Jairo Velasquez, Mateo Velasquez, who for being John Jairo Velasquez’s son don’t make him the owner of my work to claim my work. He like Juliana were never involved in my interview. However, Sebastian Lugo distribute, alter, copy, Display and perform the work publicly with them my work.
IN MORE DETAIL
In the video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEzHUU5cBo8, Pacto Satanico -El Diablo Pablo Escobar was taken from my interview and it was changed the colors ( black and white) (Please see my copy were Velasquez mentioned my name). This video was base on one of my questions of my work and my video was used. however, it was altered. This video clearly was an example of violate my exclusive rights because my work was copied, distributed, created a derived and publicly displayed my work.
Sebastian claimed with a fake statement in a counter notification because he doesn't have the copyright because he is not the editor and he does not have the copyrights because he did not organise the questions and he was only contracted and paid to record the video. However, he registed my work as he work in the DNA (Colombia) and safe creative with the name HISTORIAS DE MAFIA CON JJ.
In this other video, EL CINE Y SERIES QUE VEIA PABLO ESCOBAR. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M43sVVNfRHQ myself was removed and I was replaced by Juliana Duque ( this is a photomontage of my work) please see the copy shows both videos. This video clearly show that my exclusive rights were violated because part of my academic interviewed was used. My work was copied, distributed in YouTube without my permission, they created a derived when Juliana personated me and take the credit of my work. She also publicly perform in this video when she pretend to be me, the one who made the interview. My exclusive rights were also violated when my interview was displayed publicly.
Juliana and Sebastian send a counter notification pretending to be Sebastian Velasquez with a fake email. Sebastian even wrote his address but he removed information. I want to clarify that Juliana Duque also published this video in Facebook and istagram which mean that my material was distributed by Sebastian Lugo to a third party.
The other video which was claimed with fake counter notification was https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBI9qBmIM48, Película GUERRERO SANTO Popeye serie / los capítulos en el LINK. Sebastian wants to pretend that my interview was part of film was filmed one year before 2019, XSicario. He also doesn't own Xsicario because he sold his copyright to JJK media. My exclusive rights had been violate because a copy of a part of my material has been used in this video, my material has been distribute with a third party when it shared with Juliana Duque and Popeye Arrepentido, it has also made a derive of my work because the colors have been manipulated and it has included in a film was not part of it. The work has also display publicly in YouTube.
Sebastian and Juliana have been notified few times but they keep give fake statement in counter notification to YouTube with fake emails and names to rob my interview.On the other hand, I have received from both individuals death threats and all king of intimidations such as cyberbulling and defamation. I had been intimidated that the huspand of Juliana Duque, Rameses D Rengifo is going to use the American govern resources to find me because he works for the Miami police.","I had been victim of death threats and all kind of cyberbulling and defamation. I suffered panic attack and depression. My PhD was affected because the publication of my work and the stress that was caused in my life. Thus, the provider is taking serious a counter notification which is fraud documents and fake information."

23-CCB-0375,Dillard v.

He collaborated with Damon Lovell, Kenneth Rucker and Marquis Platt / Edwards in harassing my subscribers and I by weaponizing my own photos against me by spreading misinformation. This caused depression, anxiety, stress and fear since they also doxxed me as well and displayed my home address and family members online. The copyright infringement is just part of their attacks."
23-CCB-0374,"LATIN AMERICAN MUSIC CO. INC., et al v. Brown",https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/5801,"1. You own a valid copyright in the work or have been given an exclusive license to the copyright rights at issue in the work, I do own a valid copyright. 
According to copyright.gov: ""Once you create an original work and fix it, like taking a photograph, writing a poem or blog, or recording a new song, you are the author and the owner. Companies, organizations, and other people besides the work's creator can also be copyright owners."" The author of the composition “Boricua en la Luna” is Juan Antonio Corretjer, deceased father of Consuelo L. Corretjer. She signed his exclusive copyrights as author's heirs with the music publisher company Latin American Music Co. Inc. (LAMCO) on August 21, 1999. Moreover, the creation of this composition was fixed in 1980 and first published in 1988 by the respondent’s registration of the alleged derivative work of this original composition, with musical arrangements, PAu0001236872. This derivative work of the respondent doesn’t count with a writing agreement of copyrights exclusive rights transfer. Furthermore, on June 24, 2021, the composition was registered by Consuelo L. Corretjer, as heirs of these exclusive rights on the copyright office PA0002299059.

2. The respondent used one of your exclusive rights in the work without permission. The §204 regarding to “Execution of transfers of copyright ownership” establishes regarding to transfer any of the exclusive rights of the author over its work that, “(a) A transfer of copyright ownership, other than by operation of law, is not valid unless an instrument of conveyance, or a note or memorandum of the transfer, is in writing and signed by the owner of the rights conveyed or such owner’s duly authorized agent.” The respondent doesn’t count on a written agreement of copyrights transfer with authorization of making a derivative work, neither a subsequent permission to use any elements of this composition, “Boricua en la Luna”, in part or in whole, for any monetary gain without the authorization of the author, author's heir or music publishing company, knowledge, consent or authorization. The respondent is also allegedly granting licenses to third parties to make derivative works, reproductions, public performance, public display, from a preexisting work he doesn’t own the exclusive copyright. The evidence attached exhibits how the respondent is illegally authorizing the use of the composition to a third party “DDB Latina Puerto Rico, Inc.” advertising agency of CCPR who requested and obtained on July 18th, 2019 the license of use of the work in their advertising video from Roy Brown Ramírez, alleged copyright owner.

3. The respondent’s work is substantially similar to the original elements of expression in your work. The respondent’s work is substantially similar to the original elements of expression in Juan Antonio Corretjer’s composition. Also, the subsequent works that the respondent had been illegally authorizing, are substantially similar to the original elements of expression of “Boricua en la Luna” composition. Respondent clearly declares on his copyright registration that the musical work is a derivative work of the composition “Boricua en la Luna” from Juan Antonio Corretjer. 
Even so, without a written contract authorizing him the exclusive right that may be conferred to him by the author for the creation of a derivative work, and with full knowledge of his lack of authorship over the composition, respondent has continued with the malpractice of authorizing third parties to reproduce his illegal derivative work of musical arrangement with a composition that is not of his authorship as was expressly declared in his musical registration .","The harm being suffered as a result of the alleged activity is deprivation of copyright revenues and the misattribution of authorship over a valuable creative work, an original composition by Juan Antonio Corretjer. In addition, the royalties that have ceased to accrue since the original authorization to create a derivative work of the composition and subsequent permissions given for reproductions, public performances and derivative works illegally authorized by the respondent for this original work. The relief which is seek by this claim is to be recognized as the authentic author of this composition, the claimant and, to be compensated with the royalties and revenue forfeited."

23-CCB-0371,Walker v. Domet,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/5796,"The respondent used my work as visual aid in their work, with my copyright content taking up a significant portion of the video.

My video is an aerial tour of the city of Carmel, Indiana: showcasing the city's landmarks.

The respondents infringing content uses my drone footage to explain the city's design, documentary style. This ""mini-documentary"" does not comment on or critique the content within my video specifically.

The infringing video is currently unavailable on YouTube, because I submitted a copyright removal request through YouTube. Before the infringing video was removed however, it did appear as though it was being monetized, as there were ads displayed before the video played.

I am submitting this claim in response to the respondent submitting a counterclaim through YouTube: This means the video will be restored on YouTube in approximately 10 days, unless I provide YouTube with valid proof of myself taking legal action against the respondent.

The respondent claims to have licenses for all of the content used in their infringing video; They disclosed with me via email that they procured all of their video material from a stock video service called ""Envato Elements."" I researched this content platform, and found a user on Envato Elements with 13 videos on their profile that were infringing on my copyright content (My Aerial tour of Carmel video). In other words, it seems as if the respondent was under a false impression and infringed on my copyright by mistake, by downloading my videos from an user on Envato Elements that was using my copyright content without permission.

These licenses the respondent claims to possess are not valid. I submitted a DMCA takedown notice against the Envato Elements user, and the platform has since removed the infringing video clips which the respondent appears to have downloaded to create their infringing video.",statutory damages
23-CCB-0370,Weil v. Etsy Inc.,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/5795,"Etsy.com is hosting copyrighted material (i.e., my photos detailed here) that someone else posted, I filed a DMCA notification of the infringement (ID#s 1559923571, 1547207131) and while it initially removed the material, I later received notifications that Etsy will allow the material to be re-posted and that it will no longer remove or disable access to the material without a court order due to the sellers filing counter notices.

I originally published my photos on my Instagram and blog, and I assume this is from where they were taken.","I gave Etsy notice of the infringement and while it initially removed the material, I later received notifications that it will allow the material to be re-posted and that it will no longer remove or disable access to the material without a court order. 

Harm suffered: Etsy is allowing its sellers to misrepresent my artwork as their own by allowing my personal photos to be displayed by sellers who are not me and who are not selling my work. Etsy is further allowing sellers to defraud their buyers as whatever product they are selling is not what is depicted in the photos (being my photos of my own personal work). Buyers have no way of knowing that they are not purchasing jewelry made by me, and make the assumption that someone else is selling my work. 

These sellers are selling mass-produced items, but using my photos of my own custom one-of-a-kind artwork to depict them. Furthermore, some of these photos (specifically OEC Sakura Solitaire photo 1) clearly show my trademark hallmark stamp on the ring. This dilutes my brand because it makes it appear to my customers that I am also mass-producing artworks they understood to be one-of-a-kind. It also suggests to potential consumers that I'm selling mass produced works when in actuality my business is all custom handmade work made by me.  

The relief I'm seeking is for Etsy to no longer allow these sellers (or any others on their platform) to continue to use my personal photos."

23-CCB-0351,"Bonneau v. Owens, et al",https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/5581,"I have compiled a nearly five-hundred page description of the infringement with 250 scenes and about 2500 detailed infringements listed. There are many types of infringements used here, which I believe were created using an early form of artificial intelligence with my work as a prompt, and the request to ""rewrite"". There are what might be called paraphrases, but also para-sentences, para-language, para-stories, para-rhythms,  para-novels. It is the very essence which was copied and remixed. The characters are stolen and characteristics reassigned, mostly to affix these to one character. The names of most of the characters are copied, cut, and remixed, as well. Although my novel was published in 2016, on Amazon, and temporarily online in pirate blogs and libraries, on my own website, and was shared with other writers, agents, and publishers, I believe there is possibly an organization or application, which shares my novel as a prompt. I would like to submit the analysis I have written as part of my description later on.","The harm I have suffered is multiple. Although I have another job, I wanted to publish my work traditionally, in hopes of earning a living as an author. The fact that it was stolen, copied, and transmitted to an other writer, who might be competing directly with me, hurts my marketing ability and devalues my work. Although I am not comparing the style or the value of the infringer's contribution, the content is mine. As with any writer, I could improve on it with professional help as well.  The harm I have suffered is also psychological. First there is the immense feeling of grief, then anger about the theft itself. Making an infringement claim is also uncomfortable because I understand about intertextuality and worry that a complaint devalues me as well as the other writer. We all have our favorite authors and it is not agreeable to denounce any one. As this is not federal court and I cannot prove a ""real"" monetary loss because my book is only self-published (although Delia Owens has sold, according to the press, millions of copies), I can only request statutory relief. I would like to receive the maximum amount awarded for this claim, have her work removed , and have her expose the person, people, or application, who helped her to find and use this material."

Crazy Legs Productions, Inc., et al",https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/5550,"Ms. Welch is a local Houston artist who was commissioned by the City of Houston’s Downtown Management District to install her Work, ""Commute"". Ms. Welch’s Work received substantial press in connection with the City of Houston and the Houston Downtown Management District’s program to introduce vibrant local art into the downtown Houston landscape. 

It is Ms. Welch’s good faith belief that she did not authorize Crazy Legs Productions, TLC, or any party acting in concert to use the Work in Bad Hair Day or any other production. At no time did anyone reach out to Ms. Welch to inquire about licensing her Work for b-roll footage. To that end, and given the publicity the Work and the City’s art program received, we can only assume the unauthorized and uncompensated use of the Work was intentional and willful.

""Commute"" was in the B roll footage of The Learning Channel show ""Bad Hair Day"" in Season 1; Episode 1 from 18:07-18:08, Episode 2 at 6:22, Episode 5 at 34:32, and Episode 6 from 8:03-8:04. It was an exact shot of the mural, with no transformative context.","The Learning Channel, Crazy Legs Productions, and Warner Brothers Media made multiple unauthorized copies along with unauthorized distribution and public display of ""Commute"" as part of their footage with no compensation to Sarah Welch. When notified of the infringement, TLC and WarnerDiscovery ignored it. Counsel for Crazy Legs Productions maintains it was within its rights to include images of the artwork in the program. Ms. Welch seeks the full $30,000 in damages."

23-CCB-0344,Stokes Signs & Signs LLC v. Sheikh,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/5523,"Stokes Signs & Signs LLC was contacted by Mr. Sheikh on May 17th 2023, he emailed myself Heather Boykin a copy of his logo and asked for a custom coin slot decal to be made for him. After several emails back and forth I came up with a design and he approved. When the cost was more than he was expecting he decided he no longer wanted the design printed from Signs & Signs. He emailed on May 23rd asking for the cost to purchase the original art file so he could have printed somewhere else. I told him the price and never heard back from him again. I only provided Mr. Sheikh a proof with our company water mark on it. On July 10th 2023 our owner noticed that Mr. Sheikh had in fact used our art work and had another company print it and install decals at his carwash. The decals still had our watermark on them. I emailed Mr. Sheikh that day letting him know that he had used our art work without permission and without paying for it. He basically stated good luck and that it was his art work he created. I have pictures of the art work up at his carwash. He also put pictures online of my design on his social media. He has since put stickers over each print to try and hide our water mark after I pointed it out that it was on there. I have all copies of the email exchange to present as proof.","Our company has spent many hours creating this work for Mr. Sheikh that could have been spent working on paying customers design. The original job was quoted at $101.20 for each decal at a quantity of 10 decals. Also, a $250.00 design fee. With my added time in emails with Mr. Sheikh and research and filing of this document.  I am asking for the maximum allowed of $30,000 as this is blatant theft that has not only stolen time, orders, and our artwork. To have it reproduced 10 times by another company and then be talked about around town as if we had wronged Mr. Sheikh. He also accused me of stealing other peoples art work which is a lie he is spreading about myself and our company. Signs & Signs has been in business for 32 years in our small town and our reputation is what has gotten us that many years in business."
23-CCB-0343,Dwarika v. Rawls,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/5512,"The respondent (Kenneth) purchased my artwork from Esty on August 8th 2021, I then found exact copies of my work for purchase with the company name watermark 'MM Custom Vinyl Studios' operated and owned by Kenneth, on August 24th 2021. 

August 24th 2021 I asked Kenneth if my work could be removed, he said he didn't sell them then proceeded to block me from seeing if it had been removed.

I then later found my work on Facebook Market place and reached out to Facebook with little action from them without a registered copyright number with the US office.

On August 10th 2023 I was then informed that there were versions of my work being sold on Esty and after being presented the link to a shop, I realized it was Kenneth - MM Custom Vinyl Studios. I filled a DCMA via Esty which Kenneth countered claiming he wasn't infringing and it was a mistake by me, Esty then allowed Kenneth to continue selling and without a court order from myself, so I decided it was time to take this further. 

I reached out to Kenneth in a last attempt via his Etsy store 'MMCustomVinylStudio' on August 15th 2023 to resolve this without legal proceedings and he has yet to respond and continues to sell multiple variants of my artwork.","I would like to seek relief for statutory damages for the six versions of my work that are being copied and sold. I've had to take time way from my business to try and contact Kenneth for three years now, this is time I could have spent creating new designs. Attorneys fees have taken place of materials which are required to operate my business, this has lead to a short fall in cashflow which is vital for operation. 

I would also like my designs to not be copied going forward without my consent or a licensing agreement"

Claimant produced and recorded all tracks in his studio, including all instruments and his vocals (but not her vocals).  Respondent wished to release the song as an Artist. 
Claimant sent a track mix with his recorded vocal and music to Respondent for her to record her vocal. After recording her vocal she returned her vocal to respondent to facilitate a mix of the track. 
Respondent hired a third party to mix the track before releasing the song. The claimant sent his music stems to a third party mixer for that purpose.  Respondent released Claimant’s master with his vocal and her vocal added through UNITED MASTERS for worldwide distribution without securing a master license or license for the musical composition.
It is claimant’s position that he is 100% rights owner in the sound recording without Respondents vocal  Claimant is also a co-writer and co-owner of the musical composition.
This is a complicated issue in that respondent released Claimant’s master with Claimant’s and Respondent’s vocals and claimed it as her own.  Claimant hired an Attorney to resolve issue with Respondent to no avail.  Respondent has no basis of claim to the master.","Infringers profits, attorney and paralegal fees."

23-CCB-0338,Schultz v. Thompson,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/5440,"Mr. Thompson used many of the clips contained in this copyright on one of his YouTube Channels. They were taken down on July 28th after I had obtained the copyright. Three months after July 28th is October 28th. Therefore the takedown iterated in the attached images from Ian Boultain and Mr. Thompson are valid statutorily.

I would like to note that YouTube denied to exercise my copyright ownership without a registration and gave me no explanation. I believe they are responsible for this infringement vicariously because of deceptive practices such as this.

After I struck Thompson's channel for copyright, I believe 3 times, all of the content was removed from the particular YouTube page. But if you look at the screenshot, you can see that YouTube denies people what is blatant copyright ownership (even without registration) and making it so users cannot strike content that is theirs, unless it's uploaded to YouTube or they have an official registration which is fairly expensive. This is a deceptive practice.

Mr. Thompson had a channel called ""Hollywood Laughingstock Season Two"" uploaded and published to a video sharing service called Odysee. Several of the clips infringed on the copyright I secured on October 2nd (effective date)..

Mr Thompson used the infringement as a way to mock or denigrate me using salacious titles and actively seeking to harm my reputation.

I am pursuing the incessant harassment in State Court but will not be pursuing copyright claims in the courts as I did not possess the copyrights until after May 5th, 2023, the date of filing the action against Thompson in civil court.

Mr. Thompson was well aware he had no right to use my content and was aware of the infringement. He most likely posted this content on this obscure website ""Odysse"" due to anger over the lawsuit. In doing so, whenever it was that he did, he violated my copyright more than a dozen times.

Additionally, I have paid and submitted 71 videos for preregistration in September. Up until October 8th or so, Mr. Thompson had these works, illegal derivative works, and or direct publishing of my copyright, pending the copyright boards decision on the preregistration.

Mr. Thompson ad","Though YouTube managed to take down the infringing content expeditiously once I had a registration number, they were well aware of the infringement ongoing. Even without the ability to sue, it is still a violation of copyright law, per my understanding, to publish another's work without permission. Regardless of whether or not they can sue you and receive damages. I believe YouTube engaged in such a blatant act of negligence in this situation that they are responsible for the infringements described."

23-CCB-0336,Lane v. Aga,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/5414,"As there are three offending videos, I will address each one individually.
Video One: this was located at URL http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kRgogHaJs and was uploaded to the YouTube platform on the 14/08/2023. Whilst doing my daily checks on YouTube on the 15/08/2023, I came across the video, and saw that it featured two of my copyrighted digital art works. The digital artworks were “(G)I-DLE ‘Queencard’ Miyeon Inspired Shirt” and “(G)I-DLE ‘Queencard’ Miyeon Inspired Skirt”. This means the video included not one, but two separate designs. I state on my ROBLOX page, YouTube page and in the individual descriptions of each of my works, that using my works in any YouTube and/or other videos requires credit to myself, via a link to my YouTube channel. The respondent was using my works in their YouTube short of their virtual avatar dancing and had no credited me at all. Due to this I filed a Copyright Takedown Request with YouTube to get the offending video removed on the 15/08/2023. 
The respondent purchased my works on the ROBLOX platform, where I originally uploaded them for sale, as the respondent states in their copyright counter notification to YouTube. The respondent states that because they had purchased the artworks for use on ROBLOX, they felt that this meant they are in the “public domain”, which they are not and it clearly states this on my group wall, on the description of the items you can purchase and on my YouTube. They used my exact works in their entirety in their YouTube short. They also used other accessories on their virtual ROBLOX avatar, ones that just so happened to cover my watermarks. My work “(G)I-DLE ‘Queencard’ Miyeon Inspired Skirt” had its watermark under the left shoe covered with thigh-high black boots, which didn’t make much sense to use such items as my work already provided shoes with it. In terms of my work “(G)I-DLE ‘Queencard’ Miyeon Inspired Shirt”, the respondent used a certain hair on their virtual avatar that went over the shoulders, which just so happens to be where my watermark is on that piece of work. Due to the act of covering my watermarks, I believed the copyright infringement was done intentionally. YouTube ultimately removed the infringing video on 17/08/2023.
I don’t know the date of filing, but was notified by YouTube on the 24/09/2023, 38 days after the video was removed, that the respondent had filed a Copyright Counter Notification. In the respondent’s statement they claimed the video was an “entertaining parody on how to do the trending Queencard dance while wearing trendy clothing”, making the use of my works “fair use”. The respondent states they were “parodying” the dance from the song “Queencard”, not my works. It Is my belief after 5-6 weeks of harassment from the respondent to retrack the copyright claim, the respondent is now claiming “fair use” via “parody” as a way to infringe upon my copyrights. I’ve spoken to the respondent before about this and not once have they ever mentioned “fair use”, etc., on any of those the multiple occasions that we have spoken. Nor is it mentioned on the infringing video. In all the times we’ve spoken, and even in their copyright counter notification, they’ve admitted the works are mine and that they used it without crediting me. It’s clear the respondent had researched a few buzzwords to use in their counter notification, which would explain why they’ve never used these words as a defence up until now. In fact, the respondent had even sent me an email of their own accord, stating that it was a “legit copyright strike on the clothing I had created” which also leads me to believe the copyright counter notification is false and malicious. 
Regardless of this, it is my belief it is not fair use because in the offending video, my complete works are showcased in a game called “RH Dance Studio”. This is a game on ROBLOX that has K-POP dances pre-programmed into it and the respondent has simply just joined and pressed a singular button to do said dance. Meaning they’ve executed nothing in that game to make it a “parody”. It isn’t possible to make your avatar do said dances free hand, all the games on ROBLOX that allows you to dance like “RH Dance Studio” use pre-programmed dances. This is exactly the purpose of my artworks; they are created for wearing in Roblox games. I’ve used this same pre-programmed game myself in my own YouTube shorts a few times. I’m aware my viewers/customers use my works on ROBLOX, particularly within games such as “RH Dance Studio”, as my clothing goes hand-in-hand with the dances, to sort of roleplay their favourite idols. Hence why this game is always used in my tags on all my YouTube videos as a way of marketing my videos to the correct audience. 
The respondent also claimed in their Copyright Counter Notification that the video was “non-commercial and transformative in nature”, which isn’t true, as they then go on to state, “most of my earnings from my channel and Roblox game are reinvested back into this community on my live streams”. This contradicts their “non-commercial” statement. They also state it’s their “livelihood”, which wouldn’t make sense if they weren’t earning money from their YouTube videos. In terms of it being “transformative”, I believe this is also false as they used my artworks for what they were intended for in their entirety and then used them in a video, in the same way of which I use them on YouTube, with the intention of monetising said videos. I also believe putting accessories on their virtual avatar didn’t make it “transformative” as everyone does that on ROBLOX, for example, no one typically has a bald avatar, so adding hair, jewellery, etc, doesn’t transform the original designs in any meaningful way. 
The respondent also claimed, “the inclusion of the items did not diminish the value or market for the original work”, but I disagree, as this much bigger creator using my works without any credit to myself, has now pushed my own video of my own works (which was uploaded before the respondent’s video) further down in the search. This also means I’m getting less watch time, as people had gone to watch their video, making it harder for me to start monetizing from my own artworks. They claimed they’re “apprehensive about posting new content over the 90-day period”, which is also false as they’ve been posting non-stop ever since. Ever since the copyright strikes, the respondent has hidden a few other videos with similar content to the ones in this case (ie. “Queencard” themed, “outfit code” themed), for reasons I’m not too sure of, and has posted to date 21 new videos on their main YouTube “Aloha_Vix”, they also had 3-4 videos on their new alternative channel UDrewStarz, which they made after the copyright strikes. They have since removed most of them and only kept up one – which is seemingly about myself. Although the respondent has said all the right words to YouTube to get them to accept their Counter Notification, I don’t feel that that they have “clearly and concisely” explained, as YouTube demanded, how any of these words are applicable to their use of my works.

Video Two: which was located at URL http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSMdkEJAjkM I am unsure of the date which it was uploaded to the YouTube platform. Whilst doing my daily checks on YouTube on the 15/08/2023, I came across the video, and saw that it featured two of my copyrighted digital art works. The digital artworks were “(G)I-DLE ‘Queencard’ Miyeon Inspired Shirt” and “(G)I-DLE ‘Queencard’ Miyeon Inspired Skirt”. This means the video included not one, but two separate designs. The designs were the exact same two designs as used in video one. As the avatar was the exact same as video one, my watermarks were also covered with the same boots and hair. Their video was very similar to my content, that gives ROBLOX ID codes for users to use on ROBLOX for avatars. I state on my ROBLOX page, YouTube page and in the individual descriptions of each of my works, that using my works in any YouTube and/or other videos requires credit to myself, via a link to my YouTube channel. The respondent was using my works in their YouTube short of their virtual avatar show casing my digital clothing, again there was no credit to me at all. Due to this I filed a Copyright Takedown Request with YouTube to get the offending video removed on the 15/08/2023. 
In the Counter Notification statement, the respondent used buzzwords like in their statement for video one, such as “fair use”, “non-commercial” and “transformative”. These are words that YouTube offer in their “help sections” on their website for a copyright exception. I find it somewhat strange how in video one, they claim it’s “public domain”, but does not mention that once in the copyright counter notification for video two when it’s regarding the same two items. 
The respondent claims in their counter notification that “the items were shown on the avatars for 3 seconds at the end of the video” in this video. I believe this doesn’t matter, as the video is a “short”, so is a short length of time, but also the whole video was a build-up to showcase my works for the final part of the video, making my works the heart of the video. The entirety of my work was used, meaning it wasn’t “transformative”, once again. 
They also state “the focus was on showing my community how to dress in trendy clothing while playing Brookhaven”, which also isn’t “transformative” as the whole point of my works is that they are clothing. Another statement the respondent makes in their copyright counter notification is “I included the item IDs in the video, viewers can even use these IDs to find the items in the Roblox store and make purchases if they choose, thereby promoting the claimant's design”, which is false. Giving the IDs is not crediting, as it doesn’t actually take you to the item itself and it’s simply just a code you enter into certain games (such as RH Dance Studio, mentioned in my complaint of video one) to style your avatars momentarily. When the links are given correctly you are taken directly to my store for purchase. The IDs do not state at all who made them, that is why a link to my YouTube channel is required. 
In terms of other buzzwords such as “non-commercial” and “transformative”, what I stated in video one also applies to this. Again, they claim they’re “apprehensive about posting new content over the 90-day period”, just like for video one, which I still believe to be false as they’ve posted numerous times ever since. 

Video Three: which was located at URL https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dGraout91E I am unsure of the date which it was uploaded to the YouTube platform. Whilst doing my daily checks on YouTube on the 15/08/2023, I came across the video, and saw that it featured one of my copyrighted digital art works. The digital artwork was “(G)I-DLE ‘Queencard’ Minnie Inspired Skirt”.  This means the video included only one of my designs. Although the avatar was different from video one and video two, my watermark was also covered with the same thigh-high boots. Their video was very similar to video one, their avatar dancing to the song Queencard. I state on my ROBLOX page, YouTube page and in the individual descriptions of each of my works, that using my works in any YouTube and/or other videos requires credit to myself, via a link to my YouTube channel. The respondent was using my works in their YouTube short of their virtual avatar dancing with my artwork, again there was no credit to me at all. Due to this I filed a Copyright Takedown Request with YouTube to get the offending video removed. But after much back and forth with the respondent they ultimately removed the video themselves on the 19/08/2023 to try to save their channel from being deleted by YouTube for having copyright strikes, more about this further down in my claim. The reason I am including this video into my claim is that knowing how the respondent has behaved throughout this whole situation – there’s a high chance they’ll re-upload this third video. 
In terms of my proof of the respondent using my works; I have stills of offending video one, but no full video or anything else. I didn’t think to take extra screenshots of anything, or to save any of the videos, as YouTube doesn’t ever ask for such things. In terms of video two, I only have a still of the codes that state “free”, no other stills of my work or any full video. The still of video one does show what the avatar looked like in video two also, as it was the exact same avatar and YouTube’s emails to me would confirm I took down those two videos for the exact same works. In terms of video three, I have no stills at all. The most I have is a screenshot within a game of the respondent’s exact avatar with what was wearing in the video, but nothing of the video itself. I also have the confirmation emails from YouTube themselves stating the video was removed due to them containing my work, the exact same work that is on the avatar. The titles of the works in YouTubes confirmation emails would confirm the works used. I’m providing this screenshot just so you can see what it looked like on their avatar and to prove they’re in possession of the work. With the third video, although YouTube stated they cannot remove it as the respondent had deleted it – why would they have deleted the video when I told them to (several times, granted) if their videos were under “fair use”? When YouTube does request details when I put in copyright claim, I used to give screenshots and such as proof, but they’d always ask for more. A link to my original works and the offending works always sufficed, meaning that’s all I ever give YouTube now when they ask for further details. I take down many videos almost every day due to people using my works without crediting me. Some users will re-upload it with the correct credit, some will credit me from the get-go, some tell me they’ll never use my works again as I’ve angered them. I offered the defendant to re-upload said videos with the correct credit but after all of this, I no longer wish for them to use my works at all. There are thousands upon thousands of items on the ROBLOX catalogue, at this point it’s for the best they use someone else’s works rather than mine and hope they don’t also copyright claimed by them (as they still don’t credit people correctly, they’re just putting “disclaimer”). I asked YouTube in a response to their counter notifications if I could require the videos, as the URLs they’ve given me takes me to error screens that state the videos are private (I will provide these emails). YouTube never responded back to me, and when I sent them a separate email in general to ask about it – I was answered by a bot that didn’t read my whole email at all and assumed I had a different problem. I will be using my time to try get hold of all three offending videos if required. 
In terms of the harassment I have received; They joined my virtual ROBLOX group, where I upload all my works for sell to wear in the virtual ROBLOX games, and commented several times on there – only to later on delete their comments and try to claim I did it. They sent me friend requests on ROBLOX several times on multiple accounts, even having one of their moderators send me a friend request. They left a comment on one of my YouTube videos about it. They kept apologising to me every chance they got, which I felt was not genuine and I was clearly correct as while they were apologising to me, they were commenting false accusations about me to their viewers. 
At one point, they managed to join me within a ROBLOX game, and we spoke in said game about the copyright strikes, the game stated we were in there for “01:59:24”, it was this long due to their threats of legal action against me, their lies about deleting the third video and their bribes. Later, the respondent denied us being in there for that amount of time, claiming it was only around 30 minutes. Regardless, they admit that we did speak in the game together. I spent that time in the game trying to convince the respondent to delete the third video before YouTube deleted it, to try and save their YouTube channel as it would have been too late for me to quickly retract the last one, if was to do so, as YouTube had already removed the first two videos. Since I put all three claims in on the same day, it was likely that the third one was going to be deleted any time soon. For most of the time, they lied to me by trying to claim they had deleted it when my YouTube studio stated they only privatised it. Eventually, they deleted the video. I helped them as my intention was never to get their channel deleted, only the offending videos removed. It is my belief that if the respondent believed they had a “fair use” argument, they never would have deleted the third video and would have just put in a copyright counter notification from then. They often went on a lot about their “friend’s” channel, who I believe is just one of the respondent’s other YouTube channels, as the “friend” only ever sent me two emails about this and never spoke again, while the respondent often went on and on to me about needing their “friend’s” channel back. The “friend” had posted the exact same videos as the respondent, which I also got removed but the “friend’s” channel had been terminated due to YouTube’s “three strikes and you’re terminated” policy. To undo the copyright strikes, I would’ve had to trust them to put in the correct credits after it’s back up, and I honestly didn’t trust them with that. Considering all the lies they told me about deleting the third video, I didn’t trust them. It would’ve been easier for them to re-upload it, like offered, and credit me correctly then. As they still don’t credit people correctly, I stand by that.","YouTube states on their help centre that a way to respond to a copyright counter notification is with “A claim of copyright infringement against the uploader (if such uploader is based within the United States) with the US Copyright Office's Copyright Claims Board (CCB), where applicable.” That means that what I am seeking within this case is to keep the content from three URLS: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kRgogHaJs   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSMdkEJAjkM   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dGraout91E                                                                                    from being reinstated to YouTube by the responder to restrain the copyright infringement as requested by YouTube after the respondent filed a Counter Notification. I am also seeking statutory damages due the money I’ve been forced to spend by the respondent and YouTube for bringing this action.
This has affected me is due to the fact a larger channel was using my works without credit, caused viewers to assume the respondent made the works (which they even imply in the comments, in my opinion). But even in the case of those who won’t assume this, won’t know who or where to find the original creator. The algorithm will push the respondent’s video before my video, no one will bother watching mine as theirs is quicker and then they would’ve already seen the works. Their videos were all shorts, as that’s all the respondent ever posts, while I mainly post full length videos as YouTube requires me to get more watch time to start monetizing from my works. Works which take days to draw, upload, create videos for and then edit and upload to YouTube. This whole situation is making me no longer wish to continue my works on YouTube, or to create them at all, as I spend hours doing this just to have someone take my works, monetise my works and spout “fair use” when copyright claimed. It would be that I’m literally creating content for other creators to monetise on. I'm a creator that has come to YouTube using my own digital clothing designs, which I've seen no other creator with the same content as I do, just to get my designs stolen without just some simple credit to myself. Another reason saying it's ""public domain"" is incorrect is because I must pay to upload my works to the platform ""ROBLOX"". Even ROBLOX respects and protects my intellectual property, if they didn’t, they wouldn’t have their own DMCA system – which is also why it’s not a “public domain”. All the virtual ""Robux"" I earn from my sales are put back into my work to upload more of my artworks for in-game use. For me, this claim was nothing about money, just the fact they didn't credit me, but the offending creator has gone on and on to me multiple times now about money. Money they're making from using my designs, without some simple credit. The respondent’s online behaviour since I have put in those copyright claims has caused me stress; the harassing, two videos created about me – which is clear from their comments was to rile their over 700K community into hate against me by telling them that I’m harassing them and making fraudulent copyright claims and bullying them when any contact I’ve had with them has been purely initiated by them, sending me “Robux” to get their videos back (which was roughly about $10 worth and all their “Robux” is donated to them via their mostly child viewers on their ROBLOX “donation game”), and now this final last attack on me of forcing me to have to take legal action when they know full well their statement, what there is of it, is false. Telling me lies about the severity of the situation, such as losing their platforms, not being allowed to post, and the like repeatedly, anywhere they could, to try and guilt trip me into retracting the copyright strikes. They’ve also made comments online about getting a big ROBLOX YouTuber known as “KreekCraft” (with 8.62M subscribers) to make a video about “exposing” me for “finding YouTubers who wear my items and then strike their channels for fun”. This “outing” would undoubtedly destroy my channel after working hard to get it to over 2000 subscribers to monetise the artworks and 3D models (I do this on Roblox also) I work hard to create. I have had the constant threat of this for the last several weeks. They’ve also commented multiple times things such as “what comes around goes around”, now I’ve suddenly been hit with these counter notifications. Even after I helped them by telling them to delete one of the offending videos, and after the harassment that I’ve had, and the lies they’ve told about me online; I didn’t think it was a reasonable request to undo the punishment YouTube had given them for breaking the YouTube TOS and intentionally infringing on my copyright. If it was fair use, which it is not, they could of saved all the harassment over the last 5-6 weeks and tried to submit a counter claim 5-6 weeks ago, but they didn't, they spent this time pleading ignorance and when that didn't work they changed their justification of copyright infringement to “fair use”, because even in their counter claims they've swung between ignorance and ""fair use"". The respondent said they didn’t know about my policy of requiring credit to myself, not that they didn’t have to due to it being “fair use”. In an email to me, they said they didn’t know they had to give credits for the outfits, not only is this not an excuse for copyright infringement but I find it hard to believe. This is because their own moderator has the exact same rules as me on their own ROBLOX clothing group. Again, this shows that this was done intentionally. They state in their email to me; “I can link to you in my shorts where I use your clothing (with my 600k subscribers) and direct them to your group”. Which, again, is the respondent not wanting to link my YouTube like I ask for, as they’re clearly under the illusion I want to “steal their subscribers” as per their video that was clearly about me on their alternative YouTube channel claims. They also state; “I can add your outfits and group name to my game's catalogue which gets 7k to 15k daily active users (as I really love your clothing), any of your items sold in my game Roblox automatically gives you a portion of it”, which would give them a cut of my earnings from my own works whenever purchased in their game, meaning they’re still trying to profit off of my works. This game is also no longer even accessible, as they’ve privatised it, meaning only they can access the game."

Since then, my images have remained up, with links, redirecting traffic to the infringers sites; Fine Art America fraudulently charged my credit card nine months after my account was deleted, which they unethically kept on file after my account was removed by FAA from their platform,without notice or contact.

And now this respondent has filed a counter notice to my DMCA, claiming my copyrighted work is theirs, thus stealing more time and money from me where I have to file here at the Copyright Claims court. I honestly don't know what monetary amount I am looking for, I just have to file so that they cannot reupload my artwork on Amazon."
23-CCB-0332,Bell v. American Ranch Horse Association c/o Mike Coblenz,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/5376,"1.	Through claimant’s diligent efforts to identify unauthorized uses of Winning Isn’t Normal, on September 30, 2020 claimant discovered that on December 17, 2019, a date after claimant’s book Winning Isn’t Normal was copyrighted and registered; respondent duplicated, posted, disseminated, and displayed the work on respondent's social media account without permission from claimant. [Exhibits 4, 5]    

2.	Respondent's posts are near identical, and clearly substantially similar, to almost 100% of the section of claimant’s book: Winning Isn’t Normal, also titled: “Winning Isn’t Normal” which appears on page 8 of the INTRODUCTION of Winning Isn’t Normal.” (herein referred to as “WIN”) [Exhibit 2]  

3.	Respondent’s post was instantaneously and directly disseminated to Respondent's 19,648 followers, as well as displayed to everyone in the world with access to the Internet. 

4.	Further, respondent induced at least 142 others to repost/share WIN with their followers, thereby exacerbating the unauthorized disseminations of WIN causing a cascade of unauthorized distributions of WIN. For example, comments posted in reply to respondent's posts include:

•	“Don’t know where you found this, but I’m stealing it.  Definitely wins Facebook today!” — Ernie Dowell

•	“Marley…words to collect for another day...” — Pamela Campbell

•	“They need to post this in every locker room in school, and every training and lesson barn In America” — Katie Elkins 

5.	Respondent markets itself as “the premier ranch horse organization in the United States today. With consecutive years of double-digit growth, we are the leader in the fastest growing segment of the equine industry.” [Exhibit-6_commercial]

6.	Through these unauthorized commercial actions, respondent infringed my exclusive rights at least to: 
— reproduce the work and copy WIN; 
— distribute copies of the work, and copies of WIN to the public; 
— display the work publicly and display WIN publicly. 

7.	Moreover, claimant was given no attribution, possibly leading readers to assume that respondent was the author and copyright owner.  

8.	Respondent is not and has never been authorized to reproduce, disseminate, display, or use WIN in any way or by any means including by any advances in technology.

9.	Respondent never contacted claimant to seek permission to use WIN for any purpose. 

10.	Claimant believes respondent willfully used WIN for commercial use – namely, in connection with the marketing of themselves, in order to enhance respondent's reputations and; to improve respondents’ job performances and to further their business profits.

11.	Upon information and belief, respondent located a copy of WIN on the Internet.","1.	Claimant only permits use of claimant’s copyrighted work by way of a purchase of a copy of the work at $43.90 multiplied by: 
— the number of copies of the work and/or WIN made
— the number of copies of the work and/or WIN distributed in any manner, by any means, including by any advances in technology, or any other means
— the number of persons to whom the work and/or WIN was publicly displayed
— the number of any other means or uses

2.	Any public display of the work and or WIN is instantaneously distributed to the current number of persons who have access to the Internet. Claimant believes that respondent's uses of Winning Isn’t Normal or WIN do not qualify for any legal exemptions to display.

3.	Moreover, respondent has encouraged others to duplicate, distribute, and display Winning Isn’t Normal by inviting them to share/repost Winning Isn’t Normal: many of whom have gone on to post/share/display the Work as if it were their own creation.  

4.	The work has continued to sell every year since it was first made available for sale.  In fact, Winning Isn’t Normal sold thousands of copies through pre-publication mail-outs before it was printed. Winning Isn’t Normal continues to sell in 2023 although little or no marketing has been done for years, beyond its presence on winningisntnormal.com.

5.	Respondent has at least 19,648 followers. Had respondent purchased Winning Isn’t Normal at $43.90 per unit for everyone to whom respondent distributed the work and/or WIN [the only permitted way to use Claimant’s copyrighted works], the costs would have been prohibitive to respondent's ability to duplicate, to distribute, or to display the Work anywhere near the extent they did.  Moreover, claimant suffered huge losses of sales from respondent's failure to pay for what respondent used.

6.	Furthermore, respondent’s unauthorized uses of the work and WIN encouraged others to share WIN with their followers, thereby exacerbating the harm suffered and causing a cascade of ongoing and expanding unauthorized copying, disseminating, and public display of WIN, which induced, facilitate, and encouraged further downstream infringements.  

7.	No matter what respondent might claim are reasons why respondent wouldn’t have purchased the work and/or WIN or otherwise used the work or WIN had respondent known it was copyrighted, (or some other after-the-fact fabricated excuse – read: “if they knew they would get caught”) the fact remains that respondent gained all the benefits without purchasing the work and without authorization.

8.	There are 62 sections in the work.  Claimant is aware of an enormous number of unauthorized uses of WIN. Yet, claimant is only aware of less than a handful of unauthorized uses of all of the other 61 sections combined.

9.	Prior to claimant’s printing of claimant’s 1998 book titled “THE SWIM TO WIN PLAYBOOK,” claimant sold more than $16,000 (equivalent to more than $30,000 in 2023 dollars) worth of advertising to be included in the back pages of THE SWIM TO WIN PLAYBOOK which more than paid for the printing of 5,000 copies of said book. Claimant believes the advertisers who are still in business are still reaping the benefits of their ads now 25 years later and will continue to do so for years to come. [Exhibit-7_ads-sample pgs.1-5]

10.	Similarly, prior to claimant’s printing of claimant’s 2001 book titled “The Parent’s Guide,” claimant sold thousands of dollars worth (in 2001 dollars) of advertising for inclusion in the back pages of The Parent’s Guide.  Again, more than paying for the printing and providing claimant a profit before the book was ever printed. [Exhibit-7_ads-sample pgs.6-8]

11.	Considering the enormous popularity of WIN in most all sports and other areas in which success is desired, claimant has already begun the process of selling advertising for placement in an upcoming large print run of the work.

12.	Claimant is also in the process of including all of claimant’s existing books in a Winning Isn’t Normal series; renaming some of the titles; creating new covers; rebranding all of claimants books that were originally marketed mostly to the swimming world so as to be increasingly attractive to those seeking success in any endeavor; and has already begun the process of selling advertising for inclusion in each of the books in the newly formed Winning Isn’t Normal series.

13.	To date, claimant has been unable to negotiate a reasonable settlement for respondent's unauthorized uses of Winning Isn’t Normal. [Exhibits-8,9,10,11,12,13 various communications] 

14.	Moreover, respondent engaged in what claimant believes to be extortion in an attempt to force claimant to settle the matter for $3,000, threatening: “So you can take $3,000 now, or file suit and risk losing and even risk paying my attorney's fees. I will note that if we do prevail, I will file a motion with the court to have you declared a vexatious litigant, which will be based not only on your frequent filings but also your litigation tactics. I've done the research, and you clearly qualify. This will severely limit your ability to file these cases in the future.” [Exhibit-14_2023-07-17_Coblenz, 10:51a email]

15.	Claimant seeks a settlement in the amount of $30,000 and any other relief deemed fair and reasonable."

Through claimant’s diligent efforts to identify unauthorized uses of the work, sometime in November of 2015, a date after the work was copyrighted and registered, claimant discovered that respondent posted a copy of near 100 percent of WIN on November 10, 2015 on respondent’s social media account.

23-CCB-0327,Sloan v. Just For Littles LLC,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/5299,"My artwork, titled ""Leaping Unicorns,"" was featured on two distinct dresses manufactured and sold by Just for Littles. On their online platform, Just for Littles promoted these dresses as their ""signature JFL Unicorn Dress"" creating an impression that it was either designed exclusively for them or by them. The dresses were produced in two different colorways, both utilizing the ""Leaping Unicorn"" artwork on the fabric, with the second version being referred to as their anniversary dress. These dresses were available for purchase through various channels, including online, via social media advertisements, at the Minnesota State Fair, and in brick-and-mortar cooperative-type locations. It is also possible that they were sold through other retailers who had acquired the items wholesale through the Just For Littles wholesale program.  In the Just for Littles shop at the Minnesota State Fair, a prominent display featured images of a model wearing the dress. 

In the fall of 2022, I personally contacted the owner of Just for Littles (Tami Enz) via email, seeking information on how she had obtained my artwork for these dresses. She asserted that she had acquired a license for the artwork. However, it's important to note that my artwork is not available for licensing. I requested the owner of Just for Littles to provide details about the source of the artwork, but she indicated that it had been ""licensed to her"" and that information about ""the license"" may have been misplaced among the numerous other licenses she had procured. Despite a follow-up request for this information in September 2023, it was never provided to me.

Additionally, the owner claimed that the dresses had not been in her inventory for ""years"". However, on the day of my initial contact, the dresses were present in her shop, available in various sizes. Subsequently, the dresses were briefly removed from the online shop for a few weeks, but they reappeared in her store, notably during the period between Thanksgiving and Christmas of 2022.

It's worth noting that this same artwork had been previously involved in a federal case in 2017, which pitted me against Zulily and numerous other retailers (Wendy Sloan v. Zulily 2:17-cv-08209).  After enduring the difficult experience of that lawsuit and believing I had successfully put an end to the misuse of this artwork, discovering it at ""Just for Littles"" was especially distressing.  I did not want to have to go through that process again.  But, despite my explicit communication with the owner, wherein I made it unequivocally clear that this artwork was not to be used, she continued to use it without making any effort to provide information regarding the alleged ""licensing"" of the artwork for the dress. I have given her an opportunity to address this matter differently, but she has chosen to disregard my request for information.","Without communication from potential customers indicating their loss of interest in my fabrics, I remain unaware of the extent of business opportunities I may have missed. Prospective customers, when perusing my portfolio, extensively search the internet to identify other users of my designs prior to making a purchase. My clientele anticipates that when acquiring my fabric or the handcrafted items bearing my designs, they will receive something distinctive, setting them apart from factory-produced clothing brands. Consequently, when they encounter instances where my portfolio designs are attributed to a manufactured dress boutique, it undermines the value of my brand. This situation becomes further convoluted when these boutiques insinuate ownership of the design, as was the case with Just For Littles.

The relief I seek pertains to profits from all the dresses featuring the Leaping Unicorn designs in both colorways that were sold in Just for Littles retail and Wholesale shops. The dresses were sold at $39 or $29 when on sale.  However, I do not possess information regarding the number of dresses that were sold and how many remain in unsold inventory, so an exact relief amount is unknown at this time.   I request that all remaining inventory be sent to me so that I may donate it to a charity of my choice. In addition, I expect the respondent to share my contact information with anyone seeking details about the design's origin or how to obtain items featuring that design. Moreover, I am seeking fair compensation for the use of the artwork in signage and marketing materials.  I would also appreciate receiving the contact information of the entities responsible for printing and manufacturing the fabrics to verify that they are not the same entities previously involved in the misuse of my artwork."

23-CCB-0325,Edwards-Johns v. Bill Good Marketing,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/5249,"Bill Good improperly, without consent, used Claimant’s photograph on his Facebook page and on LinkedIn. The use of Claimant's Photograph was not licensed or otherwise authorized and was used subsequent to Author's passing. Claimant discovered the infringement once she had finalized her husband's affairs and began the arduous process of reigning in the ongoing infringement of the Work in question. Claimant has put Bill Gooding on notice of his infringement.

Mr. Good’s infringement is willful. Since finding the infringement, Claimant discovered email records between Mr. Glick (Author) and Mr. Good prior to Mr. Glick's passing. Mr. Good had reached out to Mr. Glick to discuss the purchase of several reprints or a bulk licensing deal for the Keeping God's Acre Photo. Mr Glick was willing to consider discounting the prints in bulk, but expressly stated that ""[they] are unable to offer any kind of licensing for reprints."" The negotiations then died off and no deal was struck. Despite that, Mr. Good/Bill Good Marketing proceeded to use the image for free and with willful disregard for Mr. Glick's position at the time.","Financial Harm:

- Unauthorized Use: The photograph in question, owned by the Claimant, was used without authorization by Bill Good and Bill Good Marketing. This unauthorized use constitutes a financial harm to the Claimant as they have not received any compensation for the use of their intellectual property.

- Loss of Licensing Opportunity: Mr. Glick, the Author of the photograph, had previously discussed the possibility of a licensing deal or the purchase of reprints with Bill Good. However, despite Mr. Glick's willingness to consider bulk printing at a discount, it was made clear that no licensing for reprints was available. By using the image without authorization, Bill Good Marketing deprived the Claimant of the opportunity to negotiate and potentially benefit financially from a legitimate licensing arrangement.

Emotional Distress and Burden:

- Discovery of Infringement: The Claimant discovered the infringement only after the passing of her husband, Mr. Glick. This discovery added emotional distress during an already challenging time, as the Claimant had to navigate the process of finalizing her husband's affairs while simultaneously addressing the infringement issue.

- Failed Attempts at Resolution: The Claimant attempted to resolve the infringement issue by reaching out to Bill Good Marketing, but her efforts were rebuffed. This lack of cooperation and unwillingness to rectify the situation added emotional distress to Claimant.

Willful Disregard for Mr. Glick's Position:

-The email records between Mr. Glick and Mr. Good prior to Mr. Glick's passing reveal that Bill Good was aware of the limitations regarding licensing for reprints. Despite this knowledge, Bill Good Marketing proceeded to use the image without any regard for Mr. Glick's position and the terms previously discussed. This demonstrates a willful disregard for the rights and wishes of the Author and the Claimant.

 

 

In light of the harm suffered, the Claimant seeks the following relief:

- Monetary Damages: The Claimant seeks compensation for the unauthorized use of the photograph. This compensation should reflect the fair market value of the use of the image during the period of infringement.

- Injunction: The Claimant requests Bill Good Marketing from further use the photograph without authorization.

- Accounting of Profits: The Claimant seeks an accounting of any profits or benefits derived by Bill Good Marketing from the unauthorized use of the photograph. This accounting is necessary to ensure that the Claimant is appropriately compensated for all losses suffered.

- Legal Fees: The Claimant seeks reimbursement for reasonable legal fees incurred in pursuing this infringement case. Given the willful disregard for rights, it is justifiable that Bill Good Marketing should bear the financial burden of the legal proceedings."

The infringement takes several forms: It could be construed as outright theft of intellectual property, a photo; it could also be construed as a derivative work as it has been placed in the context of defamatory materials which are a false light portrayal of the Plaintiff and violate his right to privacy. I have served multiple takedown notices upon Defendant/Respondent, but she will not remove the infringing material. 

NOT FAIR USE UNDER THE LAW
THE  DEFENDANT IS NOT A JOURNALIST. 
SHE IS A POLITICAL HACK NOTORIOUS IN THE NATIONAL MEDIA 

Defendant/Respondent is not an ISP and is not in a safe harbor under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act; Defendant is not a professional journalist, but is, on information, and belief, a discredited political operative whose advertising work has been banned from airing on ABC Television due to its defamatory, non-fact-based presentation: https://dailycaller.com/2015/04/02/abc-refuses-to-air-anti-rahm-emanuel-commercial/ 

Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Honorable Tribunal take Judicial Notice of that URL as it is publicly available, throughout the U.S., and speaks to the character of the Respondent/Defendant. 

There is no good faith argument that Defendant/Respondent can make that her infringing publication is fair use, per the Warhol case, cited, supra, in this brief.","DAMAGE CAUSED BY DEFENDANT'S INFRINGEMENT

The harm caused by Defendant/Respondent's illegal infringement is egregious: Defendant/Respondent has created a web site that uses content that I own the rights to in order to defame/slander me, so she is committing multiple illegal acts with her publication of http://www.genekoprowski.wordpress.com. As described above, supra, the illegal publication for years without authorization by me, the author and owner of the IP, is a straightforward infringement per the statute. But Defendant has also used this infringement to portray me in a false light, creating a derivative work with the context in which she publishes the photo without license.  have been a professional journalist, and award-winning documentary filmmaker for 35 years (Emmy Nomination, 2008, Three Telly Awards for Best Documentary Archival Research, 2019, 2021, 2022), and a Hermes Creative Award for Best Director (Honorable Mention, 2022). Using my family photo, Defendant/Respondent creates a false light publication, which, in context is designed to harm my reputation and confuse readers and divert them from my actual IP. Defendant is also violating my trademark which I am litigating in state court presently. 

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

As Defendant/Respondent's infringement violates 17.35 Copyrigh, Damages, Plaintiff seeks Statutory Damages (17 U.S.C. § 504(c)) of $30,000. As Defendant/Respondent's infringement is not ""innocent,"" as defined by the statute, and is ""willful,"" as defined by the statute, the maximum penalty allowed by law should be levied against Defendant/Respondent, as that would be fair, just and reasonable."

(""Claimant"") is a Pennsylvania corporation that specializes in commercially licensing premier sporting events to commercial locations such as bars, restaurants, lounges, clubhouses and similar establishments. 

By written agreement, Claimant was granted the exclusive right to license, display, and distribute publicly [17 U.S.C. § 106(4) & (5)] the Ultimate Fighting Championship® 253: Israel Adesanya vs. Paulo Costa mixed martial arts program, including all undercard bouts and commentary, on September 26, 2020 (the ""Program"") for businesses such as the business made the basis of this claim.  Commercial businesses such as the business made the basis of this suit were not authorized to receive and exhibit the Program in their commercial business without authorization from Claimant.

Respondents Objective Enterprises, Cimar Scaff, and Rick Silva (collectively the ""Respondents"") owned, operated, maintained, and controlled the commercial business known as Silva’s Sports Bar & Lounge located at 3672 S. Bristol Street, Santa Ana, CA 92704 (the “Establishment”) on the date of the Program.

Respondents Cimar Scaff (“Respondent Scaff”) and Rick Silva (“Respondent Silva”) are individuals who reside in the State of California.  On the date of the Program, Respondent Scaff was the Chief Executive Officer and President of Objective Enterprises and was the sole officer and stockholder listed on the California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control license.  On the date of the Program, Respondent Silva was the Chief Financial Officer and Secretary of Objective Enterprises.  By virtue of their position(s) as it relates to the Establishment, Respondents Cimar Scaff and Rick Silva had a right and ability to supervise the activities of the Establishment on the date of the Program and had an obvious and direct financial interest in the activities of the Establishment on the date of the Program.

Prior to the broadcast of the Program, Respondents could have contracted with Claimant and purchased authorization to exhibit the Program in the Establishment for a fee.  However, Respondents chose not to contract with Claimant or pay the fee to Claimant to obtain the proper license or authorization. At no time did Claimant give Respondents license, permission or authority to receive and exhibit the Program in the Establishment.

Instead, Respondents, including their agents, servants, and/or employees, took affirmative steps to circumvent the commercial licensing requirement and unlawfully obtained the Program and exhibited it in their Establishment. 
 
Upon information and belief, Respondents willfully engaged in illegal acts to receive the Program for free or at nominal cost while Claimant’s legitimate customers paid several thousand dollars.  Respondents knew, or should have known, their receipt and exhibition of the Program at their establishment was not authorized.

Upon information and belief, Respondents intentionally pirated the Program for the sole purpose of their own economic gain. Respondents exhibited the Program for the commercial purpose of attracting paying customers, patrons, members, and guests, thereby wrongfully benefiting financially by infringing Claimant’s rights in the Program.

Respondents did not have license, authorization, permission, or consent from Claimant to exhibit the Program in the Establishment.

As exclusive licensee of the Program, Claimant has standing and capacity to bring this action in its own name against Respondents for their violation of the Copyright Act.

Respondents’ unauthorized display and public performance of the Program through any means was in violation of 17 U.S.C. §§ 106 and 501.

Respondents’ acts of infringement were not only willful, intentional, and purposeful, but also in complete disregard of and indifference to Claimant’s rights.

Accordingly, Claimant is entitled to judgment in its favor and against each Respondent, jointly and severally, for statutory damages, in the discretion of the Board, plus interest, costs and attorneys’ fees.","Claimant seeks statutory damages in the discretion of the Board, of up to the maximum amount of $15,000.00 for the Respondents’ willful violation of 17 U.S.C. § 501 and for Claimant’s attorney’s fees, interest, and costs of proceedings."

Respondent has reinstated the video after dismissing my takedown notice of 26 July 2023 and refusing to comply.
Original copyright work has been published publicly and it is available on Youtube since 29 March 2021:
https://youtu.be/G8n3EgUlzyw","Youtube sided with the uploader and refused to cooperate when provided with required documents. Uploader is located in USA according to Youtube. But Youtube provided a UK based address of the Uploader on the counter notification claim, with a full knowledge that legal action cannot be taken and infringement claims on eCCB cannot be filed if the respondent is not based in USA. Youtube made it impossible for me to file 2nd copyright infringement by restricting a second takedown on 22 September 2023, by raising this flag ""This video has already been submitted in a previous takedown request"". I seek $5,000 in damages and also seek the removal of all infringing content of my copyrighted work from Youtube."

(Only changed a bit, but it's easy to see this man copied my idea)","I have been getting many reports from my subscribers that this channel is copying my works (Almost 20 copied works so far). My subscribers have been clicking his videos thinking that it's mine (because the thumbnails and texts are exactly the same). My channel's views get split to this guy thus less profits for me.

Lee, et al",https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/5153,"Tom Lee and Steve Knutson have knowingly used this photo over and over again, without my knowledge or permission, claiming that Tom, Lee took it. Tom Lee knew that Arthur is wearing my sweater and sunglasses in this photo and had even told me in the past that he didn't like my photos because you couldn't see his eyes.
Arthur Russell died in 1992, and Steve Knutson and Tom Lee have been actively promoting different versions of his remixed music since then. This image is recognizable by any Arthur Russell fan , internationally, at this point.","Tom Lee would have never told me about this infringement if a book company didn't force him to tell the truth about who took it when they wanted to use my photo in their book. When he did tell me of its use, he failed to mention the CD cover. After I discovered it, he promised it was published just once when it had been twice. When I asked them to fix it, Steve Knutson went around to the various online articles and changed the credits, years after the articles were written-too little too late.
I have thought long and hard about taking any legal action against them and decided I really need to.
 I have been very stressed out by all of this and just want to put an end to the crime they are committing. I would also like them fined the standard amount for this type of infringement times two, because they put this album out twice knowing that Tom did not take the photograph.
 I would like them to recall all of the Corn CD""s and records with this picture on it , prevent them from using it ever again. I would like them to redesign the cover so it does not include this photo.
They have exploited this photo. Tom Lee is an entitled misogynist who has no problem giving men photo credits!"
23-CCB-0314,Seubert v. Pendleton Chamber of Commerce,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/5125,"I discovered the images that were being used while reading articles online in the Oregonian newspaper.  It was surprising as the infringement had been going on for quite sometime.  I contacted the people who were running the campaign, they admitted to the infringement, then refused to pay for the use.  The images were taken down, but only after a demand letter was sent.","These images were used without my permission and without proper attribution.  I suffered harm as it is unknown how long and to what extent the images were used as I make my living solely as a photographer and this kind of use is part of my livelihood.  The attribution was to Travel Pendleton, so there was no secondary benefit to promote me as the author.  I lost significant income as a result.  The irony is that it is a Chamber of Commerce that is the infringer - an organization whose mission it is to promote business in the state of Oregon."

Specifically, (1) the location of the mesh bag for storing manuals and small flat parts was exactly copied, along with its size relative to the front part that is transparent, which has been purposefully chosen to increase the visibility; (2) the placement of the name tag on the sidewall, its purpose to function as a side labeling system, its relative size to the overall sidewall of the item have been exactly copied; (3) the dimensional specifications of the infringing item closely mimic or are a verbatim copy of the item being infringed upon; and (4) the PVC material on the front, which was purposefully chosen by the creator of the work to make the contents visible from the outside, was exactly copied.","It is unknown to me how many of the infringing products have been sold so far by the infringer. Accordingly, I do not have concrete knowledge of the amount of harm I suffered due to the infringement except for the time and money I spent to seek legal help. I seek USD 1,000 for the said harm. I also respectfully ask the Board to stop the infringer from selling the infringing product and order the infringer to discard all remaining items so that none thereof would be on the market to harm the product category to which my design belongs."

Plaintiff's Works/Images were unlawfully copied onto packaging for Defendants' competing CPAP Pillow, and CPAP Pillowcases, as they were sold from the US, within the US, and internationally.
Defendants are estimated to have sold between 7,967 and 47,800 pillows, at least based on Amazon reviews and ratings, which are typically provided by 1-3% of purchasers.
Defendant Peter Lei sold products with the infringing products prior to the creation of his LLC, Lumia Products Co. LLC.  See attached Exhibit 5.  For example, the Amazon listings indicated his Pillow Products were available since January 2018, but Lumia Products Co. LLC was created August 2018.  Therefore Defendant Peter Lei should be personally liable for willful copyright infringement.
- Plaintiff's works included images of himself demonstrating Plaintiff's own pillow product, thereby further indicating the egregiousness of Defendants' copying of Plaintiff's works.","- Loss of income, loss of sales, loss of market share, loss of at least any reasonable license for utilizing the works.  Damages are estimated to be approximately $125,000, which is justified based on (1) a percentage of estimated profits from the use of the copyrighted materials, or (2) a reasonable licensing fee as per the Association of Photographers' standards.
- Diversion of web traffic from plaintiff's authorized retailers and websites to the defendants' websites.
- Loss of time (400-500 hours) and money attempting to fight the infringement in courts since 2019, including small claims in California (dismissed for improper venue), federal court (dismissed without prejudice), and preparing a case with the ITC.  Plaintiff kindly requests tolling of the statute of limitations for copyright infringement in view of plaintiff's prior attempts to address the copyright infringement pro se and through other venues."
23-CCB-0311,Independent-International Pictures Corp. v. Tubi,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/5087,"Tubi, via its distribution network, including its streaming application  (app) and its website on the internet (www.tubitv.com)  on a recurring basis, has been repeatedly promoting, marketing, advertising, distributing unauthorized direct copies of Independent-International Pictures Corp's (IIP) exclusive copyrighted motion pictures, including but not limited to, THE BLOOD DRINKERS, BEAST OF BLOOD and MAD DOCTOR OF BLOOD ISLAND. The digital copies of the feature length films, each running approximately 90 minutes, made, distributed and exhibited by Tubi were created from previous older home video releases from Image Entertainment as legally licensed from IIP, which license for physical media only has long expired.
The Image Entertainment tangible home video releases of THE BLOOD DRINKERS, MAD DOCTOR OF BLOOD ISLAND and BEAST OF BLOOD were widely distributed and available to the public for purchase  in 2002 and 2004. IIP's home video license for physical media only with Image Entertainment has long expired but physical copies are still available for resale online and elsewhere via Ebay, Amazon and others.The attached screen grab from Tubi showing THE BLOOD DRINKERS features IIP's name as presenting the film.The presentations of MAD DOCTOR OF BLOOD ISLAND and BEAST OF BLOOD on Tubi featured unauthorized digital copies of IIP's home video releases but removed IIP's opening logos and which were replaced by logos for ""Action Hollywood Movies from Lightning International"" (see attached screen grab for BEAST OF BLOOD on Tubi). IIP owns the copyrights and secured the exclusive rights in all media world-wide to BEAST OF BLOOD in perpetuity as stipulated in various Agreements including the Agreement dated June 3, 2005 by and between  IIP (""buyer"") and Howard Gotbetter and Robert Pik regarding Hemisphere Pictures Inc..  Hemisphere Pictures Inc. financed and owned Beast of Blood company, producers of the motion picture BEAST OF BLOOD. See attached agreement which assigned 2/3rd of the ownership of Hemisphere Entertainment Inc., which owned the motion picture BEAST OF BLOOD, to IIP, which became the successor-in-interest to Hemisphere Pictures Inc. and Beast of Blood Company, as well as the motion picture BEAST OF BLOOD  and various other motion pictures produced and owned by Hemisphere Pictures Inc., including THE BLOOD DRINKERS and MAD DOCTOR OF BLOOD ISLAND. IIP president Samuel M. Sherman later assigned his 1/3rd ownership of Hemisphere Entertainment Inc. to IIP   (see attached documents). After numerous Cease and Desist Notifications to Tubi from IIP's agent, David Sehring of Drive-In-Sanity Films, LLC,  Tubi  continued and continues to illegally distribute and promote copyrighted films from the  IIP library without a valid license.
(see attached correspondence from Drive-In-Sanity Films LLC.)","Tubi is infringing on IIP's exclusive world-wide digital/streaming rights and causing confusion in the marketplace by exhibiting and distributing the films in digital media in the United States and various countries around the world. IIP is seeking maximum damages for the claim on the four films THE BLOOD DRINKERS, BEAST OF BLOOD, MAD DOCTOR OF BLOOD ISLAND and HORROR OF THE BLOOD MONSTERS and accounting for all distribution, downloads, receipts, territories, outlets and a list of the advertisers and the commercial spots which ran during the exhibition of IIP's four films.  As well as an injunction against Tubi's further use of IIP's properties and their destruction of any digital files that they produced and distributed and removal of any digital files on any and all servers will be required. And a full accounting of where and who supplied
unauthorized digital copies of IIP's copyrighted films.  
Samuel M. Sherman, president of IIP has a long and storied
history with Hemisphere and its films as their marketing executive
in the 1960s and 1970s. Mr. Sherman created the marketing and publicity campaigns for the films MAD DOCTOR OF BLOOD ISLAND, BEAST OF BLOOD and many other films prior to IIP's 
acquisition of Hemisphere Entertainment and the films listed here.
The recurring  infringements by Tubi continue to go on unchecked by their management and proved challenging to Mr. Sherman and IIP.  Tubi's activities have diminished Mr. Sherman's association with the films including his creative connection to them. Tubi's infingements have further hindered IIP and Mr. Sherman's ability to license or sell its films outright. 
Mr. Sherman is a highly respected film industry
veteran, especially in the world of independent films, his company IIP was a major supplier of youth-oriented movies especially in the drive-in era, which has been highly documented.
Tubi, owned by Fox Corportation, is using dismissive bullying tactics
to usurp IIP and Samuel M. Sherman's exclusive rights and reputation with Hemisphere pictures and other films from the IIP library."
23-CCB-0310,Bell v. Lewis,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/5086,"1.	Through claimant’s diligent efforts to identify unauthorized uses of the work, on February 23, 2022 claimant discovered that on or about November 23, 2020, a date after the work was copyrighted and registered; respondents duplicated, posted, disseminated, and displayed “WIN” on Bankers Life Regional Director, Chris Lewis’s, commercial social media account without authorization. [Exhibit-4_infringing post]

2.	Respondents’ posts are near identical to almost 100% of the section of the work, which appears on page 8 of the INTRODUCTION of the work: WIN. [Exhibits: 2&4]

3.	Respondents’ posts were instantaneously disseminated to respondents’ customers and 4,725 Followers  [Exhibit-4_followers] as well as displayed to everyone in the world with access to the Internet.   Claimant believes that respondents’ uses of the work and of WIN do not qualify for any legal exemptions to display.

4.	Further, respondents induced others to repost/share WIN with their followers, thereby exacerbating the unauthorized disseminations of WIN which caused a cascade of unauthorized distributions.

5.	Respondents market themselves as: one of the industry’s largest providers of Medicare Supplement and long-term care insurance” and further boast that “Bankers Life agents are dedicated to being with our clients every step of the way as they navigate retirement. Our friendly insurance agents enjoy building lasting relationships with their customers.” [Exhibit-5, marketing]

6.	Through these unauthorized commercial actions, respondents infringed claimant’s exclusive rights at least to: 
 — reproduce the work and copy WIN; 
 — distribute copies of the work and copies of WIN to the public; and 
 — display the work publicly and display WIN publicly. 

7.	Respondents are not and have never been authorized to reproduce, disseminate, display, or use WIN in any way or by any means including by any advances in technology

8.	Respondents never even bothered to contact claimant to seek permission to use WIN for any purpose.

9.	Claimant believes respondents willfully used WIN for commercial use – namely, in connection with the marketing of themselves, in order to enhance respondents’ reputations; to improve respondents’ job performances and to further their business profits.","1.	Claimant only permits use of claimant’s copyrighted work by way of a purchase of a copy of the work at $41.90 multiplied by:
 — the number of copies of the work and/or WIN made 
 — the number of copies of the work and/or WIN distributed in any manner, by any means, including by any technology, or any other means
 — the number of persons to whom the work and/or WIN was publicly displayed 
 — the number of any other means or uses

2.	Any public display of the work and or WIN is instantaneously distributed to the current number of persons who have access to the Internet. Claimant believes that respondents’ uses of Winning Isn’t Normal do not qualify for any legal exemptions to display.

3.	Moreover, respondent has encouraged others to duplicate, distribute, and display WIN by inviting them to share/repost WIN: many of whom have gone on to post/share/display WIN as if it were their own creation.

4.	The work has continued to sell every year since it was first made available for sale. In fact, the work sold thousands of copies through pre-publication mail-outs before it was printed. The work continues to sell in 2023 although little or no marketing has been done for years, beyond its presence on winningisntnormal.com.

5.	Had respondents purchased the work at $41.90 per unit for everyone to whom respondents: duplicated, distributed, shared/reposted and/or displayed the work and/or WIN, the costs would have been prohibitive to respondents’ ability to use the work and/or WIN anywhere near the extent they did. Moreover, claimant suffered huge losses of sales from respondents’ failure to pay for what respondents used.

6.	Furthermore, respondents’ unauthorized uses of the work and WIN encouraged others to share WIN with their followers, thereby exacerbating the harm suffered and caused a cascade of ongoing and expanding unauthorized copying, disseminating, and public display of WIN, which induced, facilitated, and encouraged further downstream infringements.

7.	No matter what respondents might claim are reasons why respondents wouldn’t have purchased the work and/or WIN or otherwise used the work or WIN had respondents known it was copyrighted, (or some other after-the-fact fabricated excuse – read: “if they knew they would get caught”) the fact remains that respondents gained all the benefits without purchasing the work and without authorization.

8.	There are 62 sections in the work. Claimant is aware of an enormous number of unauthorized uses of WIN. Yet, claimant is only aware of fewer than a handful of unauthorized uses of all of the other 61 sections combined.

9.	Prior to claimant’s printing of claimant’s 1998 book titled “THE SWIM TO WIN PLAYBOOK,” Claimant sold more than $16,000 (equivalent to more than $30,000 in 2023 dollars) worth of advertising to be included in THE SWIM TO WIN PLAYBOOK. This more than paid for the printing of 5,000 copies of the book and provided claimant a profit before the book was ever printed. Claimant believes the advertisers who are still in business are still reaping the benefits of their ads now 25 years later and will continue to do so for many years to come. [Exhibit-6, pgs1-5, ad examples]

10.	Similarly, prior to claimant’s printing of claimant’s 2001 book titled “The Parent’s Guide,” claimant sold thousands of dollars’ worth (in 2001 dollars) of advertising for inclusion in The Parent’s Guide as well: again, more than paying for the printing and providing claimant a profit before the book was ever printed. [Exhibit-6, pgs6-8, ad examples]

11.	Considering the enormous popularity of WIN in most all sports and other areas in which success is desired, claimant has already begun the process of selling advertising for placement in an upcoming large print run of the work.

12.	Claimant is also in the process of including all of claimant’s existing books in a Winning Isn’t Normal series; renaming some of the titles; creating new covers; rebranding all of claimant’s books that were originally marketed mostly to the swimming world so as to be increasingly attractive to those in the general population who seek success in any endeavor. Claimant has already begun the process of selling advertising for inclusion in each of the books in the newly formed Winning Isn’t Normal series.

13.	To date, claimant has been unable to negotiate a reasonable settlement for respondents’ unauthorized uses of Winning Isn’t Normal. [Exhibit 7 & 8. C&D-Communications]

14.	Claimant seeks a settlement in the amount of $30,000 and any other relief deemed fair and reasonable."

He now refuses even to acknowledge that my property continues to be available on that platform through his company's label. Despite my repeated emails alerting him to the fact that he is not authorized to distribute my property and my asking him to stop, beginning with my email on August 23, 2023, he continues to infringe on my copyright for profit.","The respondents are continuing and knowingly exploiting my copyrighted motion picture film without my permission for their own monetary gain, despite my repeated asks of them to cease and desist. Respondents have failed to ever provide any accounting for profits made by their distribution, including for their unlawful distribution the last 11 months.

On 2/27/22 the image was posted to three Instagram accounts managed by Onings Holland Inc, the wholesale supplier I purchase ranunculus corms through, with written permission and attribution to my Instagram account via tag, comment and watermark. There was an additional watermark for 'Italian Ranunculus' added to the image, which includes a semi-transparent white half dome across the bottom of the image. These accounts area @oningsamerica, @italian_ranunculus, and @henk_onings. The specific links to the posts and screenshots will be included in the supplemental material. On 7/14/22 the image was posted to the main feed of @italian_ranunculus for a second time. The respondent's Instagram account @fuirkhome follows both the @oningsamerica and @italian_ranunculus accounts. The image used by the respondent is slightly cropped compared to the original I published, and compared to the image reposted by Onings Holland Inc., but the very top portion of the half-dome watermark on the Onings images is still visible in the image the respondent is using. 
 
The respondent has been using the work as a listing photo to accompany a written description on their Shopify web store to sell ranunculus corms (dormant flower bulbs) for the specific ranunculus cultivar that is featured in the work, advertised on her site as 'Ranunculus Elegance La Dolce Vita'.  On 8/6/23 I became aware of the infringement when the respondent shared a link to her website, www.fuirkhome.com as a comment on a post about sources for small quantities of ranunculus corms in the 'Flower Farmers' Facebook group. I replied to her comment and said ""I clicked on your site and noticed you are using one of my photos for your ranunculus listings without credit or permission- can you please replace or add photo credit."" She replied also in that comment thread and said ""Oh no! For sure! I'll send you a DM and talk to the person who helped with that, too!"" 

The respondent did then send me a direct message that night through Facebook Messenger, and said ""Hi, Julia! I won't be able to get with the person who helped with pics... I was told we had permission for them all. Could you let me know which pic is the issue so I can take it down??"" I replied and said ""Thanks for messaging- the photo for the dolce vita ranunculus is mine- it has been shared by Onings with credit so I'm assuming that's where it came from. If you can add to the written description that the photo is from Full Keel Farm then it's ok to continue to use it."" On 8/8/23 she sent me a message and said ""Absolutely! Thank you so much for letting me know. I'll have they [sic] fixed tomorrow. I'm so glad you messaged me- I'm so very impressed by your farm. My apologies for an awkward introduction but I'm so glad to have discovered you.""  

On 8/10 the respondent again posted a link to her site as a comment in the Flower Farmer Facebook group. Although the respondent indicated attribution would be added by 8/9, there was no attribution for the image when she shared the link on 8/10. I checked the site again on 8/14 and saw that the listing was still active with no attribution. At this point several days had passed since the date she indicated the infringement would be remedied by, with no communication from her that she needed additional time, and with at least one instance where she promoted the link to her site with infringing material still posted and continued to profit off the unauthorized use. On 8/14 I sent a DMCA Takedown Notice to Shopify via email, and I received notice from Shopify on 8/15 that the infringing content had been removed. 

On 8/16 I received an email from the respondent stating ""Hey there! I got this notice. My apologies- I thought you were okay with me adding a reference to your farm. I can take down the photo if the link isn't acceptable. Would you consider removing the violation request?"" I responded the same day and said ""I initially notified you on 8/6 of the copyright infringement, and at that time offered to allow continued use of the image with proper attribution added. Attribution was not added by the date you indicated it would be addressed by, and you shared the link again on 8/10 to the Flower Farmer Facebook group after you were on notice of the copyright infringement. There was still no attribution for the image on 8/14 when I sent the infringement notice. You will need to find a different image to use to advertise that variety""  I received the following response also on 8/16:
""I'm happy to do that. I'm not sure if you are familiar with the widespread outages due to the storms in the region. We were without power for 30 hours and internet for 72, and I cannot do the two-step authentication from my cell phone. I added the link before I received this violation. I understand your rights and your concern. I am also a human who had no intent of harming you or your business, and made every effort to ensure that proper permissions were gathered, and remedy the situation as soon as I had the resources available to do so. I will remove the link to your site."" Although the respondent claims that attribution was added to the image prior to when I sent the DMCA Takedown Notice, I had viewed the listing the morning of 8/15, the day after the notice was sent, and there was no attribution added at that time. 

Several days later I saw that the URL's that were taken down by Shopify were restored, my content was gone, and I expected that was the end of it, and I had no intention of pursing it further. On 9/2/23 I was scrolling through Facebook and saw a sponsored post for the respondent's website. I clicked on it and saw that the listing and my photograph were back on the site, and there was no attempt to provide attribution for the image in the listing. I sent a second DMCA takedown request to Shopify on 9/2/23 and received notification from Shopify on 9/5 that the content listed as infringing in the original Takedown Notice had been taken offline. About one hour later I received notification from Shopify that the the respondent had responded to the DMCA Takedown Notice with a Counter Notice. The email indicates that the material may be replaced and access no longer disabled within 10-14 days unless Shopify receives notice that I have filed an action against the Merchant. At this point the infringing image is not posted, but the 10-14 business days has not yet elapsed. 

In my correspondence with the respondent, they did indicate as quoted above that another individual helped with the website, specifically the photos, and claim that individual communicated to the respondent that permissions were obtained for the images they were using. I am not aware of the identify of this individual, or the extent to which they participated in the infringing acts. 

I do not know the specific date when the infringement began. Based on the post history by the respondent in the Flower Farmer Facebook group, their listings for fall shipped plants, the category which includes ranunculus, were underway on June 22, 2023 and finalized by July 17, 2023. Screenshots of these comments by the respondent will be included as supplemental material. 

The infringing work is an exact copy of the work I created, which as described above has been cropped to omit the watermarks.","I am seeking statutory damages in response to the unauthorized use of the work. There are significant production costs and labor associated with growing a specialty cut flower crop like Ranunculus, and it is challenging to produce high quality stems that can be photographed as excellent examples of a specific cultivar. The particular variety in this photograph is of a newer offering, and I was among the first growers in the US to grow it as a cut flower crop and photograph it, meaning that there were limited images online of this cultivar at the time I first published it. 
 I use the photographs I take of my cut flower crops to market them to florists for cut flower sales. These photographs are an important part of the sales process, because they demonstrate the color, stem length and overall flower quality of my specific product. It is critical that florists trust that the photos I am providing along with my written description and pricing are my photographs of my crop and not just a generic photo of that particular cultivar. If my florist customers see the photo on another site without attribution, especially a sales site, they may be less inclined to believe that the photos I am using are taken by me and representative of the specific bunches of flowers they would be purchasing. This is why I was initially willing to allow continued use of the image with attribution added, and only escalated the actions against the respondent when attribution wasn't added and then the image was subsequently reposted without attribution, and the respondent continued to use the image for their own profit. 
By submitting a counter claim to the second DMCA takedown letter, the respondent has also forced me to take this action to protect the unauthorized use of my image going forward."

23-CCB-0284,Moroz v. Idemeet Offical,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/4919,"Idemeet Offical used my photo for desing of their product package (Car Drying Towel) without my permission and added the logo of their brand “Idemeet” on it. I found out that Idemeet Offical has been selling their products since tenth of June 2023 in USA (https://www.amazon.com/Absorbent-Chamois-Vehicle-Upholstery-Cleaning/dp/B0BYDFL8CB?th=1). See attachment A. 
The violation was accompanied by my complaints on Amazon marketplace (See attachment B, which was made on July 27th ) and photo evidence of  Idemeet Offical original packaging with my copyrighted photo is attached. See attachment C.
On August 14th , the above product was challenged over the use of my copyrighted photo on product packaging. The complaint was approved by Amazon, all variations of that product were blocked. See attachment D.
	On August 17th , CEO of Idemeet Offical, Jimmy sent a letter and told that he completely understood that it`s their fault to use unauthorized images. See attachment E.
	But on August 24th , I have received a counter notice from an Amazon seller where the seller of Idemeet Official Gong Ying provided false statements that infringement was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification. See attachment F.
Idemeet Offical removed my photo from the product's main image, however, naturally, it remained on the packaging. On August 28th, I sent the second complaint under the same case and the reply ""we reviewed your report and altered or removed the reported content on information you provided "" was received by me. See attachment G.
Afterwards, all variations except the one that was directly contested have been restored.
On July 31st , a sample purchase was made for both of the products, there is a photo confirming the placement of my photo on the packaging. See attachment H (control purchase), attachment I (proof of purchase and illegal placement of my copyrighted photo). 
On 7th of September, Idemeet Offical sent one more counter notice that indicates not admitting the guilt of infringement of my copyright. See attachment J.
To this claim, I attached the original photo and unedited photo to confirm my authorship. See attachment K and attachment L. 
Probably, designers of Brand Idemeet could took my photos on my Amazon page (https://www.amazon.com/Premium-Chamois-Cloth-Car-Scratch-Free/dp/B01HQWDQ1E).
Under United States Code Title 17, Chapter 1, § 102 pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works are protected.
§ 106 of the above Law states that the owner of copyright under the 17th title has the exclusive rights to do and to authorize any of the following: (1) to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords; (2) to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work.
So, Brand Idemeet violated my rights given to the copyright owner by the law. These rights include the right to make copies, distribute, publicly display, to make a “derivative” work, which is a work based on the original work.
From the chapter 5, § 501 of the United States Code comes a fact that Idemeet Offical is an infringer of my copyright and violated the exclusive rights of the copyright owner as provided by section 106.
Under title 2, § 512 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (2) Injunctions (f) Misrepresentations, Idemeet Offical knowingly materially misrepresents under (1) that material or activity is infringing, (2) that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification.  
This way Idemeet Offical shall be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees, incurred by the copyright owner, who is injured by such misrepresentation, as the result of the service provider relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing, or in replacing the removed material or ceasing to disable access to it.  
Chapter 5, § 504  of the United States Code confirms my right as a copyright owner for statutory damages in a sum of not less than $750 or more than $30,000 as the court considers just.
Considering that the desing is an important part of the business and that the brand has been operating for 3 months (since tenth of June 2023) and sells at least 50 products a day (see attachment A) for about 20 dollars, I expect to refund $ 2,000 that consists of 50% of profit and $ 500 for lawyer's services.
I have been harmed by the activities because I didn`t get any refund or royalty for using my photos. Also, the public remains in the dark that I am an author of the photo. Idemeet Offical allowed himself to create a derivative of my work and distort it without my consent. Amazon has been misled by an unfair counter notice. The notice and takedown procedures provided by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act were used to promote unfair competition and my copyright was cynically infringed.","Considering that the desing is an important part of the business and that the brand has been operating for 3 months (since tenth of June 2023) and sells at least 50 products a day (see attachment A) for about 20 dollars, I expect to refund $ 2,000 that consists of 50% of profit and $ 500 for lawyer's services.

When I filed a report of copyright infringement with Etsy, the individual filed a counter notice, forcing me to now provide proof of a court action seeking a court order against the allegedly infringing member in order to keep them from continuing to profit off of my design.","The infringer is profiting off of my work, without seeking the appropriate license to do so.

23-CCB-0281,Rivers v. Copeland,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/4879,"The offending, derivative design is so close in nature and layout to my original 'Madison River Trout Country' wall sign design that, upon first inspection, both myself and my sister thought they were identical. The second artist made little effort to differentiate their design. The 'Madison River' text was replaced with original 'Bozeman' text; but, other than that, the overall layout, design elements, and even the navy blue color was retained. The primary reason for submitting this claim is that the second artist created a design too substantially similar to my original design, which I created back in 2016 for my Montana Treasures® online store.

I am asking that Barefoot Campus Outfitter immediately cease selling and displaying (in public and online) the aforementioned offending, derivative design.

I had an attorney contact Sysco about this infringement, but they did not respond except to say that they would look into it. The entire article that contains my photograph appears to be copied from a licensed use by The New York Times at https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/21/dining/food-trends-predictions-2019.html . My contact at the New York Times confirmed to me that the use by Infringers was not licensed by them. (We are both contractually allowed to license the image, with NYT sharing revenue with me, but I am also allowed to act alone.)","I am a professional photographer who licenses images for use by companies as part of my business. I have lost income from this unlicensed use of my image. Sysco used my image commercially to promote their business to other businesses in the food service industry. They did so in a print magazine which distributed an unknown number of copies, as well as in a digital version and public display of that magazine online. I can't calculate a usage fee without knowing the scope of their use. I also seek profits derived from the unlicensed use of my image. In addition to B2B business generated by the use, display, and distribution of my image, the display of the digital issue on Issu.com is also monetized via web ads.

23-CCB-0278,"Hermes v. Alko Equestrian Center, LLC",https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/4860,"A professional photo was taken under the direct oversight of Alko Equestrian Center's representative, Doriane Woolley. The preview was then forwarded to Alko Equestrian Center, LLC for purchasing consideration. I was later informed they had opted against buying the photo rights. However, I discovered they began utilizing the photo for promotional purposes shortly after their decision not to purchase. Despite two demand letters sent, the photo remained in use up to December 8th, 2022 — a total of 28 months across platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and their official website.

I am seeking reimbursement for these 28 months at a rate of $175 per month, totaling $4900. This figure is notably lower than my standard commercial rate and aligns with typical charges. I've previously offered a discounted amount in demand letters and during a small claims court hearing. The judge acknowledged the clear infringement but advised pursuing the claim with the CCB due to jurisdictional limitations. Alko Equestrian Center, LLC willfully profited directly and indirectly from professional photographic work produced by me that they used without my permission for 28 months.","I am seeking reimbursement for these 28 months at a rate of $175 per month, totaling $4900.

23-CCB-0274,"Craftsman Book Company of America, Inc. v. Estell, et al",https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/4819,"Petitioner Craftsman Book Company of America, Inc.  (“Petitioner”) is a book publication company. Petitioner authored and printed the book “Fences and Retaining Wall” in 1990 (“1990 Book Edition”), and obtained a copyright registration for the book from the U.S. Copyright Office.” A correct and accurate copy of Copyright Registration No. TX2882408 is attached hereto as the document entitled “Copyright Registration TX2882408.pdf.” 

Petitioner’s 1990 Book Edition was reprinted several times and revised in 2012 (“2012 Book Edition”). Petitioner’s 2012 Book Edition was distributed by Petitioner in digital form only. Petitioner obtained copyright registration from the U.S. Copyright Office for its Petitioner’s 2012 Book Edition. A correct and accurate copy of Copyright Registration No. TX9302308 is attached hereto as the document entitled “Copyright Registration TX9302308.pdf.”

About 13,000 copies of Petitioner’s book entitled “Fences and Retaining Walls” have been printed and sold by Petitioner. Petitioner’s Book remains significantly relevant because several state licensing exams have questions based on what’s in the book.

Petitioner has not licensed either the 1990 or 2012 Book Editions to Respondents and has never sold the 2012 Book Edition in printed form.

Respondents are selling, offering for sale, and distributing without Petitioner’s authorization, Petitioner’s 2012 Book Edition entitled (the “Infringing Work”). Correct and accurate copies of the Infringing Work and comparisons to Petitioner’s works are attached hereto as the document entitled “Infringing Work.pdf.”

The Infringing Work is a physical copy of the contents of Petitioner’s 2012 Book Edition with the book cover for the 1990 Book Edition.

On or about July 13, 2023, Petitioner discovered Respondents were selling, offering for sale, and distributing the Infringing Work online. Namely, Respondents were selling, offering for sale, and distributing the Infringing Work on Amazon.com. 

In accordance with Amazon’s DMCA takedown procedures, Petitioner reported Respondents’ Amazon.com listings offering the Infringing Work for sale in a Notice of Infringement.

On August 21, 2023, Amazon sent Petitioner Respondents’ counter-notice. Respondents’ counter notice denied copyright infringement, and Respondents affirmatively represented that he had “a good faith belief that the material identified in the Notice of Infringement was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled” (“Counter-Notice”). A correct and accurate copy of Respondent’s Counter-Notice is attached hereto as the document entitled “Counter-Notice.pdf”

The Infringing Work infringes on Petitioner’s copyright, namely: (1) Petitioner’s exclusive rights to distribute the 1990 and 2012 Book Editions, (2) Petitioner’s exclusive rights to reproduce the 1990 and 2012 Book Editions, and (3) Petitioner’s exclusive rights to create derivative works of its 2012 Book Edition.

Further, Respondents knowingly made misrepresentations and false statements in his Counter-Notice that infringement of Petitioner’s copyright took place. Specifically, Respondents stated that the Infringing Work was “removed or disabled [from Amazon] as a result of mistake or misidentification of the [Infringing Work].” A correct and accurate copy of Respondents’ Counter-Notice is attached hereto as the document entitled “Counter-Notice.pdf”

Based upon the foregoing, Petitioner is entitled to statutory and/or actual damages.","At all times since publication of the 2012 edition of Fences and Retaining Walls, Petitioner has offered MOBI, PDF and ePub editions of Fences and Retaining Walls for sale on Petitioner's Web site. The current price of this 413-page digital edition is $23. Because questions on state contractor licensing exams are based on this publication, the work remains in demand. Petitioner has not licensed the 2012 edition of this work to resellers such as Amazon or Respondent, making Petitioner the sole source for students studying for state licensure as a specialty contractor. Copyright law gives Petitioner this right. By infringing on Petitioner's exclusive right, Petitioner has lost sales revenue and profits. The amount of lost sales and revenue can be determined only after an accounting by Respondent of the number of copies printed and sold. The infringing work is being sold by Respondent as a book published by Petitioner but over which Petitioner has no authority or control. Any errors, omissions or inconsistencies induced by Respondent in the infringing work have the potential to damage Petitioner's reputation as a technical book publisher. Each sale of the infringing work by Respondent violates Petitioner's written contract to account for and pay a royalty on sales and exposes Petitioner to a claim by the successor to author Daniel Atcheson."
23-CCB-0273,McNeil v. Howard,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/4795,"This claim for copyright infringement is made against an individual, Mr Adam Howard, being a resident of the state of Florida. Mr. Howard engages in various professional activities, which include the sale of artworks as framed prints, poster prints, and coffee mugs, and the undertaking of bespoke commissions.

The foregoing aside, Mr. Howard's primary creative endeavors appear to be in roles as a visual effects artist/supervisor in the motion picture industry, where they have worked on more than one hundred and seventy projects, as evidenced by their resume which may be viewed at the following URL.

https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0003952

It is my opinion that the respondent should thus be significantly aware of the scope and nature of copyright in general since they have been variously employed for several decades in an industry where copyright may be deemed the “lifeblood” of the same.

The infringement relates to an original photographic work that was created by me on 25 June 2008 in Edinburgh, Scotland, which was provided under contract to my former agent, WireImage (a subsidiary of Getty Images), on that same date.

Almost five years later, on 7 May 2013, the photograph in question was published under license via my agent by the New York Times as part of their obituary for the subject of the photograph, Mr. Ray Harryhausen. A copy of the New York Times’ publication of my photograph may be viewed at the URL below.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/08/movies/ray-harryhausen-cinematic-special-effects-innovator-dies-at-92.html

It is important to note that the New York Times' published use of my work is accompanied by copyright management information, in the form of a byline credit, which reads “Martin McNeil WireImage, via Getty Images”.

The related static image file on the New York Times’ web server may be viewed at the URL below, where it exists at a size of 2048 x 1669 pixels.

https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/05/08/arts/harryobit1/harryobit1-superJumbo-v4.jpg

On information and belief, the respondent would have had access to my photograph by way of the New York Times’ properly licensed and published use of the same.

On 11 November 2013, I terminated my contract with my agent, after which point no other entity had any right, title, or permission to distribute, sell, or offer licenses to make use of the photograph in question. Since that date, the photograph in question has only been available for licensing via my own archives.

On 25 August 2021, I discovered that the respondent had published a derivative copy of my work to two separate social media accounts that they operated, the first being an Instagram account adamhowardart_illustrator, and the second being a Pinterest account with the username Adam Howard Fine Art, the latter of which linked to the URL adamhowardart.com. Both publications occurred on 15 March 2021.
 
An analysis of the derivative reproduction of my original work showed that countless specific individual elements of my photograph were replicated so precisely that it suggested my photograph was used as a “digital underlay” over which the respondent created the derivative of my work; more specifically, the respondent's use of my original retained the centrally identifiable 'heart of the work' (see Angeles News Service v. KCAL-TV Channel 9, 108 F.3d 1119 (9th Cir. 1997), III ("" ...the use was substantial even though KCAL broadcast only 30 seconds of the four minute, 40 second Videotape because it was the heart of the work."")), including the textures, tone, and contrast inherent in my original, which were produced by the careful placement and setting of portable studio lighting equipment which were used to aid in the creation of my original photograph.

The respondent’s inclusion of a second element overlaid on top of their derivative of my work, which appears to be a photograph that is the property of the Ray and Diana Harryhausen Foundation, is not at issue here – however, the inclusion of this element by the respondent has some relevance, which is detailed in the supporting documents provided along with this claim. The element in question may be viewed in situ at the following URL:

https://www.nationalgalleries.org/exhibition/ray-harryhausen-titan-cinema

A related static image file with a size of 2000 x 829 pixels is present at the following URL:

https://www.nationalgalleries.org/sites/default/files/SkeletonBanner_0.jpg

On 25 August 2021, I sent correspondence to the respondent which put them on notice regarding my discovery of the unlicensed derivative of my work at the following URLs:

https://www.instagram.com/p/CMcwQb-D45j

https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/471822498470255396

In my message, I offered the respondent an opportunity to correctly license the use of my photograph as source material for their derivative of my work. No reply was ever received from them, although at some point after my correspondence, their derivate of my work was removed from these two accounts, implying receipt of my correspondence.

On 19 May 2023, through due diligence and investigative efforts, I discovered that the respondent had made additional publications of their derivative of my work, being the following:

https://www.deviantart.com/adamhoward-art/art/Ray-Harryhausen-875020515, published on 1 April 2021

https://www.flickr.com/photos/32431866@N03/52169721836, published on 24 June 2022

https://www.behance.net/gallery/152903479/Ray-Harryhausen-Tribute-2021, published on 17 September 2022

https://www.adamhoward.art/tectonic?pgid=l8x5gi4d-8875adac-4d0e-4b78-9686-b41395708dc4, publication date unknown, but believed to be some time in 2022.

The most recent publications are of relevance as they postdate both my 25 August 2021 correspondence to Mr. Howard and my copyright registration for the work in question, which bears the effective date of 28 October 2021.

It also bears mention that on 19 May 2023, I discovered information that the respondent had self-disclosed on another of their websites, adamhoward.art, being that their “Portraits [are] painted in Adobe Fresco on iPad Pro.” The ability of the Adobe Fresco software application to directly import existing images is explained in a short video which may be viewed at the following URL.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HK7HltHjg

This information supported my August 2021 analysis that the respondent is likely to have created their derivative of my work by directly importing my original photographic work into the Adobe Fresco software application before ‘tracing’ over it.","The harm suffered is my loss of ordinary licensing revenues for the derivative use of my work as part of the respondent's publication of the derivative in connection with their business activities, which would otherwise have required both advance consent and payment. As has been evidenced in Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc. v. Goldsmith (598 U.S. ___, 2023), “A photographer may also license [their] creative work to serve as a reference for an artist… licenses, for photographs or derivatives of them, are how photographers like Goldsmith make a living.”

As such, the respondent's unlicensed use of my original work represents a breach of my rights under 17 U.S.C. § 106, being that the respondent first copied my work, then directly used that copy to prepare a derivative of my work, and subsequently communicated the derivative to the public by way of publication to websites and social media accounts under their control, as part of commercial activities that included the solicitation of sales of the respondent’s works, as well as bespoke commissions.

By ignoring the copyright management information displayed alongside my photograph as published by the New York Times (as defined by 17 U.S.C. § 1202 (c)), and by also electing to make new publications of their derivative of my work long after my 25 August 2021 correspondence, the respondent would be unable to assert that they were not aware, or had no reason to believe, that their acts could constitute an infringement of my copyrights.
 
Consequently, I am seeking related relief under 17 U.S.C. § 1504 (c)(1), being a claim for an award of statutory damages not exceeding $15,000, per 17 U.S.C. § 1504 (e)(1)(A)(ii)(I), which references 17 U.S.C. § 504 (c).

My request for statutory damages is supported by the fact that the photograph in question was part of a group collection of photographs that were registered with the US Copyright Office on 28 October 2021, with such registration predating the respondent's 2022 publications of their derivative of my work by several months, thus satisfying the 'timely registration' requirements laid down in 17 U.S.C. § 412 (2) and 17 U.S.C. § 1505.

Given the purpose and character of the respondent's use of my work in the context of their commercial activities, and that my work is creative in nature and not merely factual, and that the amount and substantiality of the portion used by the respondent in relation to the original retained the 'heart of the work', and that if the respondent's use of my work were deemed to be non-infringing, it would detrimentally affect the potential market for, and value of, my both my original work and the licensing opportunities regarding authorization of derivative uses of the same, I believe that by considering these four factors individually and in the aggregate, the respondent would be unable to successfully articulate any affirmative defense under 17 U.S.C. § 107.

I additionally assert that the alterations the respondent made with respect to my original work do not meet the standard of transformativeness as established in Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569 (1994) - standards which were further delineated in Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc. v. Goldsmith (598 U.S. ___, 2023), and that this fact would also bar a successful affirmative defense of 'fair use' by the respondent."

23-CCB-0268,Adams v. Hughes,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/4671,"My footage of a Cessna 441 Conquest II performing an extremely hard landing was uploaded to YouTube on July 17, 2023 and got a lot of attention quickly. It was then found and reuploaded my many other channels without permission. 
The YouTube user 74Gear could have found my video during this period. The portion of my video that he uploaded includes whole important part of the video, the extreme hard landing, which is what everyone is there to watch. It is a direct copy of my video with some commentary. 
74Gear is using the video he created for commercial purposes (with affiliate links, AdSense ads), not for nonprofit educational purpose.
The recreated video utilized the only interesting and most substantial portions of my original video, showing the whole extreme hard landing, the whole purpose of my video.
This will have a substantial effect on the future market of my video, as future viewers will not watch my original video once they have viewed the most important part of the video on another channel first.
I filled in a copyright form through YouTube to have the content removed. YouTube reviewed the content and removed it. The user, 74Gear, filled in a counter notification. I now have 10 days to respond.","A loss in video views and future views, and I create my content for commercial purposes, relying on the advertising revenue. Also a cost of $65.00 US to file a copyright for the video. A loss of time filling out a copyright removal form through YouTube, filling out the copyright application, and filling out the CCB application. 

For relief, I would like the user to not be able to reupload the video which had been removed. Also to cover any fees I have suffered from having to officially copyright the video and to submit this CCB claim. And a portion of the users earnings from the video uploaded which contained my content (based on the percentage my content made up their video)."

23-CCB-0259,Gittler v. NYU College of Dentistry,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/4403,"Ian Gittler (""Mr. Gittler"") is a freelance photographer. In 2019, Mr. Gittler was contacted by Mun Rabot (“Agency”) to work on a commercial for NYU Dentistry School (“NYU”) and its Brooklyn expansion project. Agency informed Client that he would be working under the production company, Heads You Go West (“ProdCo”), which was owned and operated by the Agency. Before being formally engaged for the commercial, Mr. Gittler directed, shot, and edited photos for a still photo campaign with NYU. The terms of the still campaign were brokered by the producer at ProdCo, Sandra Miller (“Producer”). According to the original terms, Mr. Gittler would direct, shoot, and edit photos of eight subjects and license the photos to NYU for two years to be displayed in bus shelters, subway entrances, and digital sidewalk displays in Brooklyn. NYU was licensed to use the photographs from February 2020 until February 2022, and Client was paid his full $63,020 fee.

Shortly thereafter, the COVID-19 pandemic occurred. NYU halted the expansion of its dentistry program to Brooklyn and began to take liberties with Mr. Gittler's photos that were not agreed upon in the original deal, such as expansion of the campaign city-wide outside of Brooklyn; use of shots from twelve subjects instead of the originally agreed-upon eight subjects; and posts on social media and their website using Mr. Gittler's photos, which had not been discussed originally. 

In October, 2022, eight months after the expiration of NYU’s license, Mr. Gittler learned that his photos were still in use on NYU’s website. Mr. Gittler then notified NYU of its unauthorized use and sent them an invoice with the option to either: (1) pay $15,000 for another two years license, retroactive to the date of expiration of the first agreement; or (2) buy out the rights to Mr. Gittler's photos for $25,000. Upon this notice, NYU promptly removed Mr. Gittler's photos from its website but never responded to Mr. Gittler's request for payment.","Mr. Gittler's work has been used without his permission and he therefore is seeking that NYU either (1) pay $15,000 for another two years license, retroactive to the date of expiration of the first agreement; or (2) buy out the rights to Mr. Gittler's photos for $25,000."
23-CCB-0258,"Boho Magic LLC, et al v. Vishvakarma",https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/4364,"The work that were infriged are photographs our company produced on many shooting days and edit hours. With models and in studio. These are our designs photographs. One of the company owners is even the model. We have registered copyright for all these photos at the US Copyrights Office.
The respondent may find the photos online, on Google, on the company website, or on our Etsy shop. They probably downloaded it and used it as their own. They just copied our photo and shamelessly used it on their Etsy shop. They use our photos which have the copyright registered. They use an exact copy of our photos which you will be able to see clearly. They did so without any permission.
I sent them a few messages on Etsy messages convo. I let them know they violate our copyright and use our work without permission. They did not comply, and simply replied, ""Ok"".","This kind of use harms us by making us lose sales immediately. When people search online, they think they buy at our respected original shop but buy at the fake one. They get low quality and think it is us. It reduces our brand recognition and reputation.

We invest vast amounts of time and money producing our great professional photographs for ourselves, and they just use them without permission.
Each one of this item revenue is more than $1000 per month. Two of them have revenue of more than $6000 each, per month. We experience a huge loss in sales since the respondent started copying our work.

23-CCB-0257,Bell v. McKenzie,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/4325,"Respondent has sophisticated knowledge and use of intellectual copyright law.  On August 4, 2020 claimant discovered that respondent posted claimant’s copyrighted works on Facebook on July 6, 2019 without obtaining permission from claimant.  (Exhibit-3) This infringing content was instantaneously distributed to more than 2,100 of respondent’s followers as well as displayed to billions who have access to the Internet. This post by respondent may very well lead readers to believe respondent was the author of claimant’s copyrighted works.  Adding to the confusion, respondent noted in this same posting, “thanks Raymond L. Broughton” which may lead readers to believe Raymond Broughton was the author. (Exhibit-3). 

On August 4, 2020 claimant demanded that respondent cease all unauthorized uses; remove all uses; and pay claimant for the damages done (Exhibit-4). Claimant also gave notice to respondent that claimant believed respondent had violated the DMCA by disseminating respondent’s copyrighted text without including any of claimant’s CMI.  Respondent replied: “. . . take it up with Facebook” and “I have forwarded this to my attorney . . .” (Exhibit-5) On that same day respondent sent claimant another email with no textual message other than four “laughing” emojis. (Exhibit-6)

On July 30,2023 claimant discovered that on January 12, 2020 respondent also posted claimant’s copyrighted work on his commercial Twitter (Exhibit-7) and Facebook (Exhibit-8) accounts, again without claimant’s permission. Respondent’s infringing posts remain up today. (Exhibits 7, 8, 9)  Failing to remove these infringing posts after being warned can only be seen as another sneer in the face of copyright.

Respondent uses his infringements to promote his reputation as an author and motivational speaker.  (Exhibits-10, 11, and 12.)

Claimant believes that respondent has made at least four unique infringements, (1) his July 6, 2019 post on Facebook, (2) January 12, 2020 on Twitter (3) January 12, 2020 on Facebook (4) Violation of the DMCA by disseminating respondent’s copyrighted text without including any of claimant’s CMI DMCA while knowing or should have known that my CMI had been removed. Claimant herein makes separate claims for each of these four infringements. Claimant discovered all four on or after August 4, 2020 and all remain accessible on the Internet as of this writing.","Respondent has at least 11,600 followers and friends.  Had respondent purchased posters or books at $40 plus S&H per unit [the only permitted way to use claimant’s copyrighted works] for everyone to which respondent distributed the work; respondent’s costs would have been substantially more than $464,000 in costs saved by respondent.  Furthermore, respondent’s infringements encouraged others to share claimant’s works with their followers, thereby exacerbating damages and causing a cascade of unauthorized copying, disseminating, and public display of my copyrighted works to induce, facilitate, or encourage further downstream infringement.

As of this writing, respondent’s infringements of claimant’s works continue to be found on the Internet as well as to be displayed on respondent’s  Internet posts and to the billions who have access to the Internet.  Respondent uses his infringements to promote his reputation as an author and motivational speaker.  
 
Claimant seeks: (1) a judgment of respondent’s July 6, 2019 commercial infringement on Facebook;  (2) a judgment of respondent’s January 12, 2020 commercial infringement on Twitter; (3) a judgment of respondent’s January 12, 2020 commercial infringement on Facebook; (4) a judgment of respondent’s violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act CMI (5) a payment of $30,000 to claimant and (6) any other relief deemed fair and just."

23-CCB-0254,Betancourt v. No Mercy Music LLC / Marty Cintron CEO,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/4225,"The respondent (No Mercy LLC / Marty Cintron)
Heard me (Peter Betan) perform my work of the song (The World inside Your Eyes) live around 2004-2005
Afterwards the same evening, Marty Cintron introduced himself and expressed interest in recording my work with him singing my work for his album. He invited me to his Studio and I (the writer of the work) recorded a live guitar track of the work per his request.
After time, I followed up to get a status and progress of the recording  project and my numerous phone calls and queries remained unanswered. I came to the assumption that the recording project was abandoned, never took flight and I stopped following up.
In mid 2022 (19 years later) I was surfing youtube, and there it was. My work ""The World Inside Your Eyes"" by No Mercy - I listened. The song is unmistakably a complete copy of my work, music, melody and lyrics, with imitated production ideas as well. Marty Cintron  is the lead singer and the arrangement of the song was about a minute shorter. And to my surprise, he even placed the guitar track I recorded in his studio 19 years prior. I, Peter Betan the writer of the work, recorded, produced, sang and independently released ""The World Inside Your Eyes"" in 2004 as part of the song line up from my album ""Passion Fix"" available on line, 3 years prior to the No Mercy album release of ""Day by Day"" released 2007. Again, Marty Cintron No Mercy LLC never asked for permission to use my work nor gave me any credit. A clear case of Copyright infringement.
No Mercy LLC - Marty Cintron released, sold and distributed an album titled ""Day By Day"" in 2007 and my work ""The World inside your Eyes"" is part of the album song line up. This was all done without my permission as writer and self publisher of my work (ASCAP Registered) I regret not catching this earlier, but as I mentioned, I assumed the recording project was abandoned and steadfastly continued with my career as a writer,  performer, independent recording artist and producer. As a result, I  have suffered the consequences of the ""statute of limitations"" Law","The harm suffered is that myself as the writer of the work was never acknowledged as the writer of the work. No permission was ever discussed or asked. It was done illegally and unprofessionally. And lastly, I was never compensated monetarily for any sales, royalties and distribution of my work."

23-CCB-0243,Hughes v. WGBH EDUCATIONAL FOUNDATION,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/4142,"I wrote an article in hope that NATURE MAGAZINE would publish it. It's a 2,000 word theory of Nature's process of evolution. My theory shows scientific CAUSE & EFFECT. Cause & effect is the cornerstone of any science. My theory explains that Nature uses a three part process: Threat, FEAR, and Fortification. FEAR is the core idea of my evolutionary process. FEAR is the internal mechanism of evolution. Fear is what gives evolution acceleration or a deceleration in evolutionary speed within time. if one ever woke in a gasp, feeling fear, this is the point where life began. Before my article, world wide biologist relied on random mutations by natural selection. Mutations provide no scientific process, it being a wait and see result. WGBH produces NOVA on PBS as episodic television relying on audience size for its success. WGBH produces NOVA as a form of entertainment and is not a scientific laboratory. WGBH never sought my permission to use my work.
There are many direct quotes in WGBH's NOVA episodes from my theory. I employed some rhetoric in my written theory. Before I discovered the process of evolution biology science had no real, tangible, and verifiable CAUSE & EFFECT like other sciences. It had randomness, a flip of a coin, or toss of a hat, a wait and see position. There are experiments performed in correlation to my theory. In the first episode a field scientist says reproduction for prey animals had changed because of the lack of predators, or the lack of fear. Reproduction of organisms is one of the keys of evolution and is a key to my theory. Before me the biologists scratched their heads in confusion, not knowing where reproduction fit in with mutations. Also in the first episode a group of researchers, in a studio watching video, studied how animals reacted to a predator. These scientists, for their first time ever, had a valid way to study animals in flight from fear and know why they take flight. An experiment of caging up a grasshopper with a spider nearby, to see its reproduction results. In the second episode there was mention of many experiments with grasshoppers and spiders pent up together, and how the experiments effected the grasshoppers' reproduction. The mutation idea cannot be experimented with mutations because it doesn't have a cause nor effect for experimentation. At the end of episode one a scientist looked directly into the camera, as if he was speaking to an audience of biologists, quoting my article said 'it's simple'. Also he said 'Coexistence'. These words are rhetorical and part of my theory. The second episode of NATURE'S FEAR FACTOR a new team was in, researching and testing my theory of fear and evolution. My first reaction upon watching the first episode was how did they get ahold of my article? Then I remembered the NATURE Magazine article that i submitted and how WGBH must have received the article from NATURE magazine. Then I thought WGBH and NOVA are in the television business and could easily throw together film footage from something else and edit it together in a hurry to get a NATURE'S FEAR FACTOR episode. What I found most flagrant of WGBH's infringement was both episodes had absolutely no mention or references of my work, of my process of evolution. In science literature, science television shows, and science magazines there usually is a cornucopia of references mentioned in these shows and magazines with a full line-up of PhDs and professors telling their audience how their work came into being. They would tell of why fear became important to this research. How this research into fear was initiated. There was no mention of the result the professors and PhDs wanted to accomplish either in the show because there were no PhDs and professors to lay claim to my work. No mention of what NOVA and WGBH wanted to accomplish with this research of fear. My process of evolution has no precedent or mention of prior research by Professors and PhDs either and that's because my process of evolution has never been discovered until I discovered it. There exists absolutely no precedent  or reference to it prior to my submitted NATURE magazine article. A big part of WGBH's damage to me is that these NOVA episodes have not given me any protection internationally and domestically. I am discovering magazine articles almost each day wherein my work is being infringed upon. If WGBH only allowed me to oversee my work on NOVA it would have allowed me to contain control of my ideas. I found oversea laboratories experimenting using my process of evolution. I am now getting ready to chase countless copyright infringements that most likely will take the next twenty years of my life if I'm blessed to live that long.","I'm suffering countless infringements that are piling up at me feet because of what WGBH has done to me. A simple acknowledgement would have prevented mass infringement, it 
would have brought me enough support and notoriety that it could have made my disabled life better.

On November 13, 2020, Claimant discovered that beginning on or about June 4, 2018, Respondent reproduced, distributed, and displayed Claimant’s copyrighted photograph of a prominent youth activist on the shoulders of an older woman attending a “March For Science” in Washington D.C. in 2007 in connection with Respondent’s publication on its website, and possibly elsewhere.
Claimant’s photograph is not only used without her knowledge or permission, Respondent fails to provide Claimant’s authorship credit for her photograph despite the presence of Claimant’s authorship credit when the photograph was first published on an authorized third-party website, with an authorship credit indicating Julie Dermansky as the author, and despite the fact that Respondent knew or should have known that it does not own the photograph. Claimant believes Respondent knowingly failed to include credit to Claimant in order to conceal its own infringement and/or to induce, facilitate, or encourage further downstream infringement.

This distribution took place through an online gallery bearing the business name ""Elle Danielle"" and including the same in the gallery URL. Both Johnson and Haynes-Nelson were fully aware of the copyrights held by the photographer, as indicated in the signed wedding contract.

After Johnson and Haynes-Nelson's distribution, an agent representing The Tennessee Tribune intentionally downloaded the entire gallery of images. Subsequently, these images were unlawfully reproduced, distributed, and publicly displayed across four full pages of the publication, reaching a wide readership across the state of Tennessee.","The harm suffered by the claimant includes lost licensing fees for 52 images as well the Infringer's profits in distributing the works to more than 150,000 readers across the state of Tennessee."

We designed the Donald Trump postcard in April of 2023 and began selling the postcard online the same month. We offer these postcard designs for sale on Etsy. The respondent copied our postcard designs and began selling them on Etsy in May of 2023. The respondent's postcards are nearly identical to ours and a reasonable consumer would not distinguish the minor differences between our designs and the respondent's designs. The respondent has copied the layout of our designs, the color scheme of our designs, and the text of our designs.","The extent of the harm suffered as a result of the respondent infringing on our copyrighted designs is not known at this time, as we do not have access to the respondent's bookkeeping and sales records.

2) My video is being used to push commercial product.
3) Infringing video is acting as a market substitute. Watching the offending video does not offer a different experience from the original video.
4) The offending video harms the market value of the original video.
5) The offending video also stole thumbnail of original video, causing further confusion.

All stolen work is of me, not stock footage, in my own private home. 

The infringing video does not display itself as a reaction video despite having ""Surgeon Reacts"" in the title.

In music, there are many cases where similar sounds happen inconsequentially from one another. However, in this case, Blissful Endings has multiple elements that are coincidental with the track My Way. The drums, piano melody, main melody(vocals) and bass line are all strikingly similar. The end of My Way features a piano being played on its own, which sounds nearly identical to Blissful Endings.","I have been mentally disturbed by the inability to fight this infringement. ECCB has given me hope that I can proceed and have the claim heard in court. My music passions and careers have been in a mental state of helplessness, and I am seeking some type of monetary re-course for my work being used. I do not have any specific dollar amount or royalty percentage that I am looking for, but that is the relief that I would like. My name listed in some form of credit is a secondary goal of mine. I feel that work should be compensated, and work being used without any recognition or compensation is a serious infringement which leads to situations like mine."

23-CCB-0232,"Joe Hand Promotions, Inc. v. High Elevation Investments LLC, et al",https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/3895,"Claimant Joe Hand Promotions, Inc. (""Claimant"") is a Pennsylvania corporation that specializes in commercially licensing premier sporting events to commercial locations such as bars, restaurants, lounges, clubhouses and similar establishments. 

By written agreement, Claimant was granted the exclusive right to license, display, and distribute publicly [17 U.S.C. § 106(4) & (5)] the Ultimate Fighting Championship® 251: Kamaru Usman vs. Jorge Masvidal mixed martial arts program, including all undercard bouts and commentary, on July 11, 2020 (the ""Program"") for businesses such as the business made the basis of this claim.  Commercial businesses such as the business made the basis of this suit were not authorized to receive and exhibit the Program in their commercial business without authorization from Claimant.

Respondents High Elevation Investments LLC, Literature & Libations LLC, Bryan N. Gay, Tonya J. Gay, and Nathan D. Jorgenson (collectively the ""Respondents"") owned, operated, maintained, and controlled the commercial business known as Mulligan’s Pub located at 1115 S. 3rd Street, Laramie, WY 82070 (the “Establishment”) on the date of the Program.

Respondents Bryan N. Gay, Tonya J. Gay, and Nathan D. Jorgenson are individuals who resides in the State of Wyoming and were members, managers, officers and/or principals of the entity(ies) owning and operating the Establishment on the date of the Program.  Respondents Bryan N. Gay, Tonya J. Gay, and Nathan D. Jorgenson had a right and ability to supervise the activities of the Establishment on the date of the Program and had an obvious and direct financial interest in the activities of the Establishment on the date of the Program.

Prior to the broadcast of the Program, Respondents could have contracted with Claimant and purchased authorization to exhibit the Program in the Establishment for a fee.  However, Respondents chose not to contract with Claimant or pay the fee to Claimant to obtain the proper license or authorization. At no time did Claimant give Respondents license, permission or authority to receive and exhibit the Program in the Establishment.

Instead, Respondents, including their agents, servants, and/or employees, took affirmative steps to circumvent the commercial licensing requirement and unlawfully obtained the Program and exhibited it in their Establishment. 
 
Upon information and belief, Respondents willfully engaged in illegal acts to receive the Program for free or at nominal cost while Claimant’s legitimate customers paid several thousand dollars.  Respondents knew, or should have known, their receipt and exhibition of the Program at their establishment was not authorized.

Upon information and belief, Respondents intentionally pirated the Program for the sole purpose of their own economic gain. Respondents exhibited the Program for the commercial purpose of attracting paying customers, patrons, members, and guests, thereby wrongfully benefiting financially by infringing Claimant’s rights in the Program.

Respondents did not have license, authorization, permission, or consent from Claimant to exhibit the Program in the Establishment.

As exclusive licensee of the Program, Claimant has standing and capacity to bring this action in its own name against Respondents for their violation of the Copyright Act.

Respondents’ unauthorized display and public performance of the Program through any means was in violation of 17 U.S.C. §§ 106 and 501.

Respondents’ acts of infringement were not only willful, intentional, and purposeful, but also in complete disregard of and indifference to Claimant’s rights.

Accordingly, Claimant is entitled to judgment in its favor and against each Respondent, jointly and severally, for statutory damages, in the discretion of the Board, plus interest, costs and attorneys’ fees.","Claimant seeks statutory damages in the discretion of the Board, of up to the maximum amount of $15,000.00 for the Respondents’ willful violation of 17 U.S.C. § 501 and for Claimant’s attorney’s fees, interest, and costs of proceedings."
23-CCB-0231,Razak v. Bosley,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/3882,"Bosley is posting work via their YouTube channel and other social media platforms that I have not authorized the release to them. I was the Director, so the creative content was performed by me and the intellectual property is mine. I also produced the content as my duties included: creating the content, organizing the shoot, negotiating, advising on locations and scheduling. In addition, I performed the post-editing.
I have a copyright filing for this content and it is provided within the evidence. 
I was not a ""work for hire"" employee as there was no expressly written agreement between me any other company, Therefore, there was no agreement that the work would be considered ""made for hire"", nor did I sign anything from any company involved stating this.

The Copyright Office issued Registration Number PAU4166196 for a commercial titled “Bosley ‘Let’s Go'"""". The three works described in this claim are a copyright infringement as they are parts of the original copyright that the respondent is creating into several different commercials on YouTube. They have disbanded the original work and recut into similar works.  All parts of the works introduced in this claim are part of the copyright that was filed and are different works that have been made public after my first initial claim with the CCB.

As stated, I was the director of these works, produced, and edited them. I sent directly to Bosley's representatives the rough cut of these works, so they had access to them and used them without any final authorization and payment. The understanding from me, since I did not have a fully executed contract, was that I would shoot the commercial and then get paid for it. Bosley received the rough cut after partial payment and decided to use that and create their own final versions without providing full compensation.

To be clear, the entirety of the works that are listed in this claim are derived directly from the rough cut of film that Bosley had access to. The works are not only similar, they are one and the same, just strategically recut and reformatted.","Bosley continues to use the content that I have created, produced, directed and edited without monetary compensation. I have explicitly advised them not to use it and filed an official copyright filing and multiple YouTube disputes."

Jane Beiles Photography LLC is hired by builders, architects and designers to take photos of projects to help promote their businesses.

23-CCB-0211,"Rooney v. Von Paris, et al",https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/3620,"On April 19th,2018, I created a slogan for a product, which was intended to be listed alongside the product on an e-commerce website, as well as on the back of the blister packaging for the product. Originally, I intended to work with Alexandra and Route One Apparel to bring this product to market on their website. However, she pulled out of our agreement and decided to copy my product and then perform indefensibly clear and deliberate copyright infringement by copying and pasting the slogan/product description that I wrote for use on their website. It was the identical product description used without my permission or knowledge. The copyright was assigned in 2022 but dated to 2018. See below for reference to my copyright and what was on her website. 

To my knowledge, the first publication of this work was on March 26, 2021, when I reviewed her website to see if she was selling a product similar to mine.  

Copyright certificates create a rebuttable presumption that the work in question is copyrightable if the copyright is registered within the first five years of the work being created. Bus. Mgmt. Int'l v. Labyrinth Bus. Sols., LLC, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24900 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 24, 2009). The presumption can be rebutted by a showing that Plaintiff deliberately misrepresented material facts in their registration or certificate. Serv.& Training v. Data Gen. Corp., 963 F.2d 680, 688 (4th Cir. 1992).Because copyright infringement claims are only two-pronged, and the first prong is ownership of a valid copyright which is satisfied by the presumption of validity, the only relevant inquiry is whether the infringing work copies original elements of the copywritten work. Fonar Corp. v. Domenick, 105F.3d 99, 104-105 (2d Cir. 1997).

Whether an allegedly infringing work is actually infringing is determined by a ""two part, extrinsic/intrinsic test for substantial similarity."" Positive Black Talk, Inc. v. CashMoney Records, Inc., No. 02-0425, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6843 (E.D. La. Apr.21, 2003). When determining if a substantial similarity exists: first the extrinsic test considers whether two works share a similarity of ideas and expression based on external, objective criteria… If a plaintiff satisfies the extrinsic test, then subjective intrinsic test asks whether an ordinary, reasonable observer would find a substantial similarity of expression of the shared idea.

Smith v.Jackson, 84 F.3d 1213(9th Cir. 1996). The two works contain almost identical language between the descriptions, and the only originality that Route One provided was cutting a sentence and changing the product name. Based on the objective criteria of direct word-to-word comparisons, the two descriptions are virtually identical and certainly share a similarity of ideas and expression of those ideas. The intrinsic test would also be satisfied by a judge or jury, because no reasonable observer would view the two almost identical descriptions and find any strong, relevant differences that show any originality by Route One. As there are no grounds for a reasonable observer to find the two works to be different expressions of the shared idea, Route One is certainly infringing on my copyright.

The individual was messaging my father's friends, I believe in an attempt to scam them in the method described here: https://www.wral.com/story/don-t-accept-that-facebook-friend-request-cross-platform-messaging-scam-making-a-comeback/20309777/.

Since that time, I have contacted instagram with DMCA takedown requests on multiple occasions, asking them to remove the infringing photograph or the user's profile altogether.  I have carefully specified that it is the profile picture of the account that is the infringing photograph.  It is difficult to obtain direct links to profile pictures on instagram because of the way the site is coded, but in the most recent request, I managed to obtain a direct URL (the same one I link to above) to the photograph and sent them that URL as well.  On each occasion, instagram has responded that I am linking to an entire profile, rather than a specific work that violates my copyright.  However, on each occasion, I have been clear that it is the profile picture that violates the copyright.","Statutory damages in the amount of $4999, and I would like Instagram to agree to take down the photograph."

Second Foundation Partners LLC, et al",https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/3607,"Respondents copied the photograph in question and publicly displayed it on the website ""Epsilon Theory"" (www.epsilontheory.com). Claimant's photograph, which is still displayed publicly, was displayed alongside two blog posts promoting Respondents' goods and services. Claimant has never given Respondents permission or authority to copy or publicly display the photograph. Claimant notified Respondents of these allegations by email and by U.S. mail in December of 2020 and in March of 2021. Respondents never responded to these notices. As of filing, Respondents have removed the photograph from one portion of its website, the “Notes of the Field” page, but the photograph remains posted under the page “The Industrially Necessary Doctor Tedros,” and the images remain publicly accessible on Respondents' web servers.","Claimant is harmed by (1) the loss of licensing revenue, and (2) the lost scarcity value of the image which will negatively affect future licensing revenue. 

Under §1504(e)(1)(A)(ii) and §504(c) of the Copyright Act, Claimant is entitled to up to $15,000 statutory damages for the unauthorized use of the photograph, which was timely registered under §412 of the Act."
23-CCB-0207,"Tickerrank Inc, et al v. Arora, et al",https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/3585,"I, Suraj Waghulde, the owner of tickerrank.com , have built machine learning models that take data from intrinio.com and eodHistoricaldata.com and rank the stocks in different verticals like
growth, value, risk, market segment and market expansion generating these metrics (scores). My neighbor - Sameer Arora learned that I have built the model and built a stock recommendation engine from myself while our kids
were playing in the community park. Sameer is very interested in stock market investing and talked me into providing him all the details of the model and learned that the model output is
very good. Sameer copied all the ideas I had and along with his other friend Syed H Shah (who is
the official owner of therocketstocks.com) built therocketstocks.com exactly imitating my idea and data. They have a secret 50% - 50% partnership between Sameer Arora and Syed Shah as Sameer was not a permanent resident
of the US at the time I established my business https://www.tickerrank.com . Since I launched tickerrank.com in September 2020 therocketstocks.com has been
copying 40% of our recommendations as Sameer is infringing the copyrighted data from TickerRank and selling it to Syed H Shah. I confronted Sameer about copying verbally and he agreed he is giving all the data to his partner Syed Shah to post
on therocketstocks.com. After that discussion we decided that we will do an agreement between therocketstocks.com and tickerrank.com so that output of tickerrank.com's machine
learning model will be shared partially to therocketstocks.com with redistribution license.
However therocketstocks.com never made an agreement and kept infringing tickerrank.com's
copyrighted recommendations till this date. Since myself tickerrank.com's owner had continuously followed
up with therocketstocks.com to stop the copyright infringement and do the agreement to use our
recommendations, a lot of infringed data was removed after that from their website to prove word to word copy of our recommendations. Also therocketstocks.com removes old infringed data after a few months and keeps copying our new recommendations so that we have hard time to prove that there is infringement. I have a email communication between therocketstocks.com and tickerrank.com about the agreement and 
copyright infringement notices we sent to therocketstocks.com . therocketstocks.com do not have any machine learning model or algorithm or AI tools as their website suggests. therocketstocks.com service copies recommendations from several websites,
mainly our website tickerrank.com as they know our recommendations are very good. Among
the others they copy investors.com, motley fool, stockanalysis.com. Sameer has given me access to his investors.com account without asking and told me he can provide access to all such
websites in a shared google drive folder which I never asked for or checked. I, the owner of tickerrank.com had been nicely communicating with therocketstocks.com to not step
on tickerrank.com business infringing tickerrank.com copyrights but therocketstocks.com is still doing willful copyright infringement and has copied and derived information from over 400 of our copyrighted material. They copy our buy recommendations a few days or weeks or sometimes couple of months after as they know our recommendations are for long term, generally 18+ months. Since we have been continuously asking them to stop copying they realized it is easy to prove if they copy as it is so
now they copy our recommendation and copy more information of the stock we are recommending from other websites - many times infringing the other websites copyrights and add  available public information and technical charts about the stock. They
used to copy our recommendation word by word but now they have stopped it / changed it since we told them we will file a lawsuit. To show that they are not deriving stock recommendation from our website they copy technical and other information for the stock from other websites most of the time infringing the other
websites copyrights (recommendations, price-target, graphs). We submitted official 
DMAC request to completely take down this
website which has copied business ideas and infringed upon more than 400 of our
recommendations possibly way more since the past 2 years - they have removed the old 300+ infringed
recommendations. Sameer has infringed our copyrights my sharing our recommendations on different chat groups on whatsapp to gain popularity for past 3 years. One of my friend from such group confirmed the infringement. I have approached Sameer more than 10 times with good proposals to figure this out however he is so determined in stealing and doing willful copyright infringement that I am had to take a step to file a legal case with copyright claims board given I do not have money to sue him in federal court. I seek help from copyright claim board to bring justice to my hard work and original content I published.

I took the picture in question in 1978 (which is noted at the bottom of the catalog page).  Suzanne had access to the picture due to her relationship with Eugene.  She knew at the time that I was the person who took the photograph, because I discussed copyrighting the picture then.  We have had subsequent, recent conversations in which she acknowledged that I am the photographer of that picture.","To the extent that the Respondent is using the photograph to sell the artwork of the subject of the photograph across multiple forms of media and sources, a portion of Respondent's financial gain can be attributed to advertising the artwork for sale by using the photograph.  I would like to be appropriately compensated for the use of the photograph.  Any further use of the photograph must properly attribute me as the source of the photograph."

Trendey, LLC",https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/3454,"In March of 2023, an online image monitoring service notified me that one of my photos had been published on the website Trendey.com.  The publication could have occurred much earlier than March, but that is when a search was performed which showed the photo displayed on the website.   

Without seeking or receiving my permission, Trendey.com posted my copyrighted photograph on its commercial website, which is monetized through advertisements and affiliate referral fees.  The photograph is of a living room scene, and it was made for a client of mine who is an interior designer.  Screenshots of the infringing usage were made, which show the photo displayed on the homepage of Trendey.com, and as the large headline image at the top of the article in which it was used.  The unlicensed publication represents a clear infringement of my copyright to the photograph.  I acknowledge that the photograph has been removed from the Trendey.com site after my initial contact.  However, such removal, although required, does not address the issue of monetary damages resulting from the illegal copyright infringement.

The owner of Trendey.com has claimed protection from liability under the DMCA Safe Harbor regime.  However, Trendey.com is not eligible for such protections, and published the photo directly after asking for, and not receiving, permission.  Please see attached Infringement Claim document.","The infringing usage devalues my photograph, deprived me of licensing revenue, and has taken a great deal of my time to address.

23-CCB-0193,"Cass, et al v. Ice",https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/3420,"A Ft. Worth Star Telegram reporter obtained an unauthorized copy of our Braniff International Flight 352 Cockpit Voice Recording and  proceeded to post it on the Ft. Worth Star Telegram's website and on their YouTube page. We filed complaint with YouTube and the video of the transcript was taken down but Ft Worth Star Telegram filed a counter response, which has forced us to file this action. 

Please note that it is against Department of Transportation regulations  to release or distribute cockpit voice recording tapes for any reason other than ongoing litigation. This was conveyed to Ft. Worth Star Telegram but was ignored. Ft Worth Star Telegram obtained the  unauthorized copy of the tape from the archives of Seller's Recording Studio in Dallas, Texas. In June 1968, Braniff's Vice President Harry McKillop hired Seller's to transcribe the tape with specific instructions for only three copies to be recorded including a copy for the Department of Transportation; the Federal Aviation Administration and finally, Braniff Airways, Incorporated. Braniff has asked that Ft. Worth Star Telegram return the fourth unauthorized copy of the tape to Braniff but it has not fulfilled this request at the time of this filing.

Seller's at no time was authorized to create a copy for their own personal use. The accident notes that discuss the Seller's commission at no time give Seller's authority to create a fourth tape. Braniff is very cautious about the release of corporate documents and archives and retention of the rights to those materials and this would have been no exception. It was later discovered that the owner of Seller's Recording Studio was a native of Corsicana, Texas, which was near the accident site and most likely created a fourth copy of the tape for his own archives. The DOT tape was returned to Braniff in 1972 and is currently held in our Archives; the FAA tape was destroyed in 1974 by the FAA and the Braniff copy also resides in Braniff's Archives in Dallas, Texas. 

Ft. Worth Star Telegram, further, released this transcript and tape only two days before Braniff was hosting a special event at the accident site to reveal a new Texas Historical Marker that marked that accident and honored the passengers, families and Braniff employees lost or involved in the accident. This caused many family members to erroneously believe that Braniff had dramatically released the recording to create hype and draw attention to the marker reveal event on April 29, 2023. This was certainly not the case but it created a tension filled atmosphere for company employees on the day of the event and the night prior to the event via social media.","The unauthorized release of this tape caused great grief to the families and Braniff employees lost or involved in the accident. Further, it was believed that Braniff had released the tape to generate hype and promotion for the April 28, 2023, Braniff Flight 352 Texas Historical Marker reveal ceremony, an act that Braniff would never commit or involve itself in at any time or for any reason. In addition, it has enabled countless millions to view and hear the private and copyrighted conversations of Braniff employees that were on the transcript and tape without their authorization, which is a direct violation of work place privacy. The families of the employees that were involved with the flight have been subjected to unnecessary scrutiny especially since the pilot and Braniff were ultimately blamed for the accident."

The respondent did so without properly crediting me for my work on the underlying compositional elements used to create the infringing work. I asked the respondent, before the release was published, to properly name me in the release credit of the infringing work. The respondent refused to comply with my request for credit.","The infringing work used my compositional information enough that it would not be clear to the general listener who was the original author of the underlying composition. This damages my reputation to mutual parties between the respondent and I. This damage to my reputation has a direct effect on my ability to become involved in musical collaborations with other parties and music producers. It causes undue stress, emotional hardship, and protecting my copyrights takes away significant amounts of my time and attention that would otherwise be focused on my normal business.

23-CCB-0187,"Reed v. Karen Selby, et al",https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/3371,"Respondents Ralph O. Selby, Karen Selby, and (upon information and belief) Kalamazoo Regional Theater LLC associated for the purpose of creating, producing, and presenting for profit a musical play known as TWO PRINCES (the “Play”). Claimant shall refer to this association as “The Association.” Claimant asserts The Association constitutes a partnership under New York law, and that the respondents are jointly and severally liable for the alleged infringements.

On August 24, 2020, Respondents Ralph O. Selby and Karen Selby entered into a written agreement with Claimant, whereby Claimant would create the score, orchestrations, and new music for the Play. (Original music and lyrics were authored by Respondent Ralph O. Selby, and Claimant asserts no claim to those underlying works.) 

Claimant authored and delivered to Respondents the works set forth in Reg. No. PAU004171017 and Reg. No. SRu001541199.

The Parties subsequently had a falling out and informally agreed to terminate the August 24, 2020 agreement. In January, 2023 Claimant’s counsel delivered a proposed termination agreement to Respondents whereby, in part: Respondents would agree to cease any use of Claimant’s work; Claimant would agree to cease any use of Respondents’ work; no party would assert any claim or ownership to any work(s) of the other; all previous licenses would terminate; and neither party would owe anything to the other. 

Respondents rejected Claimant’s proposed termination agreement. Accordingly, by letter dated February 3, 2023 Claimant’s counsel informed Respondents of the following:

•	Because it had been rejected, the proposed termination agreement of January 2023 was no longer viable.
•	All licenses previously granted by Claimant (express or implied) were immediately revoked.
•	If Respondents wished to license Claimant’s works for use in the Play, there would be a fee of $6,250 and a written license agreement would be required.
•	If Respondents wished to obtain copyright ownership of Claimant’s works by assignment, there would be a fee of $15,000.
•	If Respondents did not intend to pursue either license or assignment, all uses of Claimant’s work must immediately cease.
•	Failing either of the three options (license, assignment, or cessation of all use), any use of Claimant’s works would be considered copyright infringement and pursued as such.

Respondents ignored the February 3, 2023 letter, and their use of Claimant’s works continued. Using Claimant’s works, Respondents engaged artistic personnel, rehearsed, and ultimately performed the Play on April 9, 2023 in a livestream concert version event on the “Live From 54Below” platform. 

Respondents also posted Claimant’s registered sound recordings on the SoundCloud streaming platform.

Claimant provided Respondents with two very clear opportunities either to license Claimant’s works or to cease all use. Respondents knowingly ignored Claimant’s communications and willfully infringed the works.","For the alleged infringements of the works set forth in Reg. No. PAU004171017 Claimant seeks actual damages of $6,250 and an order to cease all present and future use.

The registration date for Reg. No. SRu001541199 is May 4, 2023.  Upon information and belief, the works set forth in that registration are unpublished because Respondents made them available on SoundCloud for listening but not download. Claimant reserves the right to examine this point further as the proceeding progresses. Assuming it to be correct, however,  Claimant seeks statutory damages of $3,000 for each of the three works identified in this proceeding – for a total of $9,000 and an order to cease all present and future use. Claimant has captured and attaches evidence of this infringing activity occurring after the date of registration. (Note, as well: the filenames contain Claimant’s initials. Respondents posted Claimant’s own sound recording files.)

23-CCB-0173,Rackers v. Paramount Global,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/3135,"My work was used in the streaming version of Cheers, Season 5, Episode 26 as the featured music at the end of the episode.

I have not been provided with Sync Licenses (one as copyright owner and one as sound recording owner) or compensation for this usage, nor I have I received any notification or credit.

Paramount+ has claimed that they have access to my catalog of works through a company called Music Dealers Publishing. I have no record of being involved with this company and Paramount+ has not provided me with any documentation. Music Dealers Publishing was listed on my PRO (ASCAP) cue sheet along with In Grooves Publishing, which has since removed their claim to my work in ASCAP because In Grooves Publishing has confirmed that I have never been in their catalog (I have email documentation showing this).

The first time this episode of Cheers appeared on my cue sheet was in 2019. After doing some research, I have found that Music Dealers Publishing went out of business in 2016, three full years before my music was used in this episode. So, despite Paramount+'s insistence that they have rights to use my work through a deal with Music Dealers Publishing (which again, I have no record of and they can't produce a license for), their blanket license agreement with Music Dealers Publishing should be irrelevant since they used my work well after Music Dealers Publishing was no longer in business. I could not have possibly agreed to this usage since they weren't even in business, even if I was involved with Music Dealer Publishing (which again, I have no record of).","I was never provided with a Sync License for usage of my composition and sound recording in this episode and was never notified of the usage. I only discovered this usage when a Cheers fan used the app Shazam to identify me and they reached out to me online. 

I was not aware of this usage because I had not been in my PRO (ASCAP) account since about 2016/17 since switching careers (due to lack of payment for my work, such as this usage). If I had known my work was being used in a Cheers episode, I would have kept my album up for sale. I should be appropriately credited for my work appearing in this episode, including through ISMDb account, so that I can try to actually build more sync opportunities and sell albums. 

In addition to not having a Sync License in place for usage of my work, this work is also coded as ""background music"" on my PRO (ASCAP) cue sheet, which I assume yields lower royalty rates. My music replaced an Irving Berlin composition and is clearly not background music (in fact, the closed captioning doesn't even list my work title, it lists the original Irving Berlin composition title). It is a featured piece that sets the stage for this season finale of Cheers. My Sync Licenses need to reflect this usage of my work and include re-coded of my work appropriately. 

I am seeking appropriate Sync Licenses for usage of my work, one license for $8,000 as the copyright holder and one license for $8,000 as the sound recording owner. I am seeking damages of $3000 for my work being miscoded with my PRO as background music to account for lost royalties from that miscoding. The new licenses provided need to include the appropriate coding. I am also seeking additional damages of $6000 in lost album revenue and lost business. Finally, I am seeking recuperation of my legal fees with Romano Law Firm up to $5000 for the initial investigation required for this case.  

The total monetary relief I am seeking is $25,000 plus legal fees.

Because of its popularity, this episode receives hundreds of thousands of plays every year. It has likely received well over a million streams since being used in the digital streaming version of this episode. I don't even know the extent of the harm because my cue sheet doesn't even show the number of plays for some of the streaming services that this show is on. This is one of the most popular shows in TV history and one of the most popular episodes in both the series and season. The monetary relief that I am seeking is commensurate with this popular since my Sync Licenses should have been reflective of this usage initially."

Upon careful analysis of the code, we have reason to believe that this extension is a near identical copy of a previous version of our own extension (AIPRM for ChatGPT v1.1.3.30 / ojnbohmppadfgpejeebfnmnknjdlckgj), despite the author’s efforts to make it difficult to compare by minifying and renaming the source code files with a .min.js suffix.

We hold the copyright for the code used in our extension, and we have good faith to believe that the publishing of the “AIB Prompts - AI Best Prompts for ChatGPT” (dacncaemlfalkbcbjjhjofehfbncacoo) extension constitutes a violation of our copyrighted code. We have stated this clearly in our terms.

In addition to the mentioned IP violation the extension “AIB Prompts - AI Best Prompts for ChatGPT” (dacncaemlfalkbcbjjhjofehfbncacoo) provides most of our content duplicated and provided as theirs, which underlines their malicious behavior.

This matter has emerged previously with the extension “AI Best Prompts” (mjleijebibkimdhhgpnbddfckldienfc), which was subsequently removed from the Chrome Web Store for copyright infringement. We now find that the same author has reintroduced a similar extension, further emphasizing the repetitive nature of this issue.

We can provide detailed diff analysis to back this up, and answer any question you may have, ASAP.

Given the repetitive nature of this issue, we respectfully request that this extension be removed and the author blocked to prevent further copyright infringement. We anticipate a swift and effective resolution to this matter.","Loss of revenue, loss of new user signups. Damage expected to have surpassed $25.000 in April 2023 alone."

23-CCB-0169,"McNeil v. Experience the Fight Media LLC, et al",https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/3105,"This claim for copyright infringement is made jointly and severally against the corporate entity Experience the Fight Media LLC, and its sole director and CEO, Mr. Saif Ibraheem, in his personal capacity. Mr. Ibraheem and/or Experience the Fight Media LLC engage in for-profit business activities under various names such as ""Ultimate Fan Experience"", ""UFE World"", ""UFE Media"", ""UFE NFT"", and possibly other stylings that are unknown to me at this time.

The infringement relates to an original photographic work that was created by me on 6 April 2013 in Stockholm, Sweden, and provided under license to my client, SB Nation (a subsidiary of Vox Media, Inc.), on that same date; the photograph was promptly published by my client to their website MMAFighting.com. An archival copy of my client's published use may be viewed at the following URL

https://web.archive.org/web/20130408235448/http://www.mmafighting.com/ufc/2013/4/6/4191584/irish-conor-mcgregor-booked-for-boston-fight-after-sensational-ufc

On 27 March 2020, the same client (SB Nation) published the photograph in question on one of their Twitter accounts, as permitted by the terms of the prior license granted to them. This publication may be viewed at the URL below.

https://twitter.com/MMAFighting/status/1243326888140996610

On information and belief, the respondents and/or their employees or agents would have had access to my photograph by way of my client's properly licensed and published uses.

At all times since the date of its creation, the photograph in question has been my sole property, and no other person or entity has had any right, title, or permission to distribute, sell, or offer licenses to make use of this photograph; the photograph in question is available for licensing from my archives as at the following URL from 2013 onwards:

https://martinmcneilphoto.photoshelter.com/image/I0000h7goB6N6z7g

The photograph in question was used by the respondents on 6 April 2023 in social media postings to accounts connected to their for-profit business activities, being publications to Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram as part of efforts to solicit public engagement with their business venture; the respondent's published use of my work was altered from my original by desaturating it to be monochromatic, rotating it approximately twelve degrees counterclockwise from its original orientation, and cropping out elements of the original photograph whilst still retaining the 'heart of the work' (see Angeles News Service v. KCAL-TV Channel 9, 108 F.3d 1119 (9th Cir. 1997), III ("" ...the use was substantial even though KCAL broadcast only 30 seconds of the four minute, 40 second Videotape because it was the heart of the work."")). The respondents also overlaid a logo with the words ""UFE Ultimate Fan Experience"" on the lower right-hand corner of my photograph, implying copyright ownership of my work.

On 6 April 2023, takedown requests compliant with 17 U.S.C. § 512 (c)(3)(a) parts (i) through (vi) inclusive were issued for the respondent's social media postings that included their derivative of my original work.

On 10 April 2023, Instagram responded to my takedown request indicating that they had ""removed or disabled access to the reported content.""

At some time between April 7 and April 25, Facebook responded to my takedown request, though emails from Facebook relating to this appear to have been accidentally deleted from my systems.

On 25 April 2023, Twitter responded to my takedown request, indicating they had ""reviewed [my] allegations of copyright infringement, and have removed the content that you reported from our site.""

On 25 April 2023, I received an email directly from Mr. Ibraheem stating ""I was sent an email stating that we used your photo illegally due to a copyright violation. My apologies. We can take it down. I just do not want a strike from twitter. There was no ill intent from our end."" (sic)

On 25 April 2023, I sent an email to Mr. Ibraheem, offering them the opportunity to settle the matter of their publication of the unlicensed derivative of my work to their three social media accounts for my lost licensing revenues alone, indicating I would be open to a reply no later than 9 May 2023. This message included a copy of my registration certificate VA 1-867-530, and PDF copies of their unlicensed reproductions of my work.

On 26 April 2023, I received an email from Twitter, stating ""We’re writing to let you know we’ve received a DMCA counter-notice about the materials you reported on the Twitter account @ufeworld.""

On 9 May 2023, I received an email from Twitter, ""We’re writing to let you know that we’ve ceased withholding the material.""

On 10 May 2023, I once again reached out to Mr. Ibraheem, having had no prior reply from them, restating my offer to settle the matter for my lost licensing revenues only.

On 10 May 2023, Mr. Ibraheem responded and, over the course of several messages, variously indicated their refusal to acknowledge that the infringing act had caused any loss to me, asserted that they had not profited or otherwise benefited from their infringing act, stated their refusal to settle the matter for my lost licensing revenues, and claimed that they had ceased to make use of my work.

Contrary to Mr. Ibraheem's assertions, the unlicensed derivative use of my work is ongoing as of the time of filing this claim, per the URL below:

https://twitter.com/ufeworld/status/1643982267835121670

It is noteworthy that the Twitter accounts @ufenft, @saif_1424, and @safeanalyst also re-tweeted the above posting, since these three accounts appear to be operated by Mr. Saif Ibraheem.

I believe it is relevant that the respondents did not lodge DMCA counter-claims regarding the published uses of my work on Instagram or Facebook, instead only contesting the takedown notification sent to Twitter on the basis that they ""just do not want a strike from twitter."" (sic), which is not a valid ground for submitting a counter-notification per 17 U.S.C § 512 (g)(2)(3).

I also believe it is relevant that Mr. Ibraheem did not disclose the existence of their related corporate entity Experience the Fight Media LLC - a fact that was only discovered during evidence gathering and due diligence on the afternoon of 12 May 2023, by way of information gleaned from Mr. Ibraheem's LinkedIn profile which self-declares the association between Experience the Fight Media LLC and the for-profit enterprise operating under the names ""Ultimate Fan Experience"" and other related stylings.

As a resident of the state of Wisconsin, I believe that Mr. Ibraheem may be held jointly and severally liable along with the corporate entity of which he is the sole director, especially since the common law rationale for piercing the corporate veil in the state of Wisconsin is the ""alter ego"" doctrine where a person deals with their own property through a corporation just as if they were dealing with it individually (see Milwaukee Toy Co. v. Industrial Comm'n of Wis., 203 Wis. 493, 234 N.W. 748 (1931) 495-96 (""applying the corporate fiction would accomplish some fraudulent purpose, operate as a constructive fraud, or defeat some equitable claim."")).

The foregoing is of relevance since Mr. Ibraheem responded to the 25 April 2023 takedown notification in their personal capacity, and made no mention of their role as the sole director and CEO of Experience the Fight Media LLC.","The harm suffered is my loss of ordinary licensing revenues for the derivative use of my work as part of the respondent's social media engagement efforts in connection with their for-profit business activities, which would otherwise have required both advance consent and payment. I have licensed similar uses of my work to other client and non-client entities for fees up to high four-figure sums and can provide evidence of such licenses if necessary.

As such, the respondent's use of my original work represents a breach of my rights under 17 U.S.C. § 106, being that the respondents and/or their employees or agents first copied my work, then used that copy to prepare a derivative of my work, and subsequently communicated the derivative to the public by way of publication to three separate social media accounts under their control.

In overlaying my photograph with a logo/text reading ""UFE Ultimate Fan Experience"", implying ownership of my photograph, the respondents also breached 17 U.S.C. § 1202 (a)(2), as the logo/text would meet the definition of copyright management information as set out in 17 U.S.C. § 1202 (c).

Consequently, I am seeking related relief under 17 U.S.C. § 1504 (c)(1), being a claim for an award of statutory damages not exceeding $15,000, per 17 U.S.C. § 1504 (e)(1)(A)(ii)(I), which references 17 U.S.C. § 504 (c).

I am also seeking relief per 17 U.S.C. § 1504 (c)(3)(B), being a claim for statutory damages of no less than $2,500 and no more than $25,000, for the respondent's breach of 17 U.S.C. § 1202.

My request for statutory damages is supported by the fact that the photograph in question was part of a group collection of photographs that were registered with the US Copyright Office on 11 April 2013, with the registration predating the respondent's unlicensed use of my work for almost ten years, thus satisfying the 'timely registration' requirements laid down in 17 U.S.C. § 412 (2) and 17 U.S.C. § 1505.

Given the purpose and character of the respondent's use of my work in the context of their for-profit business activities, and that my work is creative in nature and not merely factual, and that the amount and substantiality of the portion used by the respondents in relation to the original retained the 'heart of the work', and that if the respondent's use of my work were deemed to be non-infringing, it would detrimentally affect the potential market for, and value of, my original work, I believe that by considering these four factors individually and in the aggregate, the respondents would be unable to successfully articulate any affirmative defense under 17 U.S.C. § 107; I also assert that the minor alterations that the respondents made to my original work do not meet the standard of transformativeness as established in Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569 (1994), which again would bar a successful affirmative defense of 'fair use' by the respondents.

Lastly, my request for liability for the infringement of my copyright to attach jointly and severally to respondents Experience the Fight Media LLC, and Mr. Saif Ibraheem in their individual capacity, is supported by 17 U.S.C. § 1504 (f)."

23-CCB-0161,REICH v. THE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/3057,"On the dates indicated I wrote and had published the group copyrighted works for the New York Times. There was no written contract but according to Copyright Law, the absence of a written contract grants a publisher only First North American Serial Rights, with all rights reverting to the author after publication. The New York Times subsequently posted the works online and passed some of them on to other online newspapers; the works are still available online. According to copyright law, electronic rights must be negotiated separately from print rights. In my case, no electronic rights were ever negotiated.","The New York Times has, essentially, used my work without my permission. Normally, I and other authors receive compensation for subsequent publication electronically. The New York Times also had no right to pass any of the work on to other online. If that had been their desire, compensation should have been negotiated with me. I am seeking a sum of $2500 for the infringement."

I still didn't catch on. I paid one of Blurbs technical experts to help me upload work. Ok, that is over with. After submitting work to Blurb.com I began to finish up the online publishing contract and ran into another obstacle that should have been very easy to fix. There was no help from Blurb when practically begging them to help me complete the financial process for any interest in buying my book.  Blurbs online contract would not let me simply put in my zip code for completion. This small task would not let me go forward or complete sellers information. Not long afterward I began hearing about my manuscripts word for word. A little later an acquaintance told me that my book was out there being publicly displayed. I knew this was true from what I was hearing before this person told me that my book was being circulated. I had not told this person anything about my work and the person quoted the subjects I spoke about in Systemic Racism in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Blurb.com took my work and is benefitting from my creation while blocking me from having any part in the sell of my own work.","It's like sabotage. Its infringement. I feel violated. My hard work at writing that was also being embarked upon due to severe job discrimination is now under attack. My attempt at pulling myself out of the poverty the severe job discrimination caused sort of left an impression of no hope in trying; or informing the nation of what the system can do to its citizens without any criminal record.

23-CCB-0156,"Conner v. Life Rich Publishings, aka, Author Solutions Inc,, et al",https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/2968,"Hacking complaint or IC3  complaint on LIfeRich publishing aka AuthorSolutions Inc., Readers Digest 

Financial reparations are being sought from Life Rich Publishing, aka, Author Solutions Inc., now an affiliate of Readers Digest for being involved with my  apartment managers in pursuing me for over twenty years to every apartment rented succeeding at illegal searches and seizures of my papers, phones, and electronics ordered by an official concealing misconduct right up under the law. Around November 2021 I was sent an email from readers digest on behalf of LifeRich Publishing the book publishers for Readers Digest. The email stated: 'I have the book and after editing the book send it to LifeRich Publishing and they will publish book for me.' I was surprised and quite concerned because I 've been damaged before but I let the email pass because I didn't tell anyone, not anyone this time about my writing this book. Not long afterwards I began hearing too many words, sentences and subjects that is included in my book, Systemic Racism in the Commonwealth of Virginia, and I knew that Life Rich Publishing and Readers Digest had illegally downloaded a copy of my unedited manuscript as the email suggested. 
A copy of my book had to be retrieved through hacking. I began researching Readers Digest and their affiliate LifeRich Publishing and discovered LifeRich Publishing is the same as Author Solutions Inc.","Over a decade ago Author Solutions Inc was taken to Richmond VA Federal Court for damaging my first book. Author Solutions worked with Lionsgate Production Company that made a movie from my first book, case 404-cv-117. After learning about all this, Author Solutions Inc. then had the nerve to continue selling my book after a request was made in writing to cancel the contract and stop selling my work because of that TV movie. I thought it was over but six years after placing in writing to Author Solutions to stop selling work I found my work, 404-cv-117 at Barnes and Noble. Authors Solutions, now Life Rich Publishing, damaged me bad therefore I proceeded to take them to the US District Court for Richmond, Virginia, case: 08-10216  involving intellectual property crime. It could easily be determined that the judge was biased and on the money side, dismissing case against Author Solutions.  This was the third obvious attack on my work, again, after that poor decision given by the first judge in case 404-cv-117.

Forward fast to year, 2022 and Author Solutions, aka, Life Rich Publishings is at it again. From events that followed after requesting that IC3-a division of the Department of Justice investigate that Readers Digest email,  (highlighted and underlined above) I'm positive that Author Solutions, aka, Life Rich Publishing an affiliate of Readers Digest hacked my computer around November 2021 and stole a copy of my latest work, Systemic Racism in the Commonwealth of Virginia. According to all the resemblances to my latest work and actual word for word references I know again I've been taken and of course always the public. Author Solutions, aka, Life Rich Publishing and Readers Digest have dissected my book and spread my words before I could even publish this book.The judge in case 404-cv-117 gave the approval to pursue after me, criminally implying that my literary creations was up for grabs.

The unmistakable events that followed after the IC3 investigation was nothing. It was remarkable causing me to know something serious went down. Readers Digest had begun emailing me everyday, sometimes twice a day. Much too many emails. I was always familiar with Readers Digest. My Mom would purchase books from them ever so often when I was a child far before Life Rich publishings became a part of them. When those emails just stopped abruptly, all of a sudden after the IC3 complaint, was all I needed to know that they had done this thing, particularly knowing the prior battles I had with Author Solutions aka Life Rich Publishings. 

                                     RELIEF

Criminal Charges should be brought for the respondents desperately stalking me electronically but I know that is not going to happen This time I seek more than but thirty thousand dollars from Life Rich Publishings but if this is all I can seek then so be it! Under  Computer Crimes 18 USC 2320 Crimes and Criminal Procedure, Part I – Crimes Chapter113 – Stolen Property sec. g/2a intellectual property I'm asking that I be granted thirty thousand dollars from Life Rich Publishing and thirty thousand also from Readers Digest.

My life was threatened and I feel that it still is based on persons consistantly using my works without me having any contracts with them or knowledge of exactly who is behind this. The police has not helped me and this has just been an ongoing thing. It seems that everyone is against me and is for stealing from me.

1.
Dear Michelle,
I am a junior editor at a small publishing house in Marseille, France, called Le bruit du monde (which roughly translates as ""the sounds of the world""). We are going to publish a translation into French of the memoir/autobiographical essay of a young Norwegian writer and researcher, Jan Grue. In his memoir, he deals with the issue of being a disabled man in a world that isn't meant for him to fit in, and also tells us about how he eventually came to terms with his extra-ordinary being-in-the-world, and learned to accept it. His voice is strong and we wanted to make it heard to French readers. In his book, he reminisces on how living in Amsterdam as an exchange student was both a wonderful and trying experience : the cobblestone streets, the canals, the city itself weren't meant to welcome a person in a wheelchair, and yet he came to love it and its atmosphere. He specifically remembers listening to your song again and again, ""5 am in Amsterdam"". He quotes 5 lines of the song in his book, and we were wondering if we could quote those lines too in our edition. Being a huge fan of yours, I thought I'd reach out personally. Looking forward to hearing from you,
Many thanks for your attention, Léa

I promptly responded to Lea on April 5, 2023 as follows:

2.
Dear Léa
I'm pleased to hear from you concerning licensing the lyrics from my song ""Five AM in Amsterdam"" for the memoir ""I LIve a Life Like Yours"" by Jan Grue. A few thoughts come to mind: Why, I wonder, was this not first brought to my attention by Pushkin Press when Mr. Grue's book was published in English, apparently on November 4, 2021? Was there a prior publication in Norway as well?
Michael J. Fox Reviews a Thoughtful Memoir on the Challenges of Living with Disability Aug 15, 2021  https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/15/books/review/i-live-a-life-like-yours-jan-grue.html
It has been my experience that licensing my lyrics for print publication typically brings other considerations: online lyric display and keyword search. Your brief outline below did not mention these, but trademark enforcement for keyword search becomes a consideration, particularly in relation to Amazon's predatory online marketplace. I will be happy to discuss a licensing proposal for print lyric display and will trust that the context for my lyrics are as you represented, and not as a subtext or otherwise subversive implication for my work or reputation. Or welcome to provide me with an English version of the manuscript, to determine for myself. Any information or contact you can provide for the author's prior publishing representatives is also appreciated.
Kind regards, Michelle Shocked, Campfire Girl Publishing

Lea responded on April 5, 2023 as follows:

3.
Dear Michelle,
Thank you so much for getting back to me so quickly! I understand your concern if I’m the first editor to ask to license your lyrics – the book was indeed first printed in Norwegian, then in the US, I believe. I haven’t been in touch with those editors, but I’m sure you can find the information online.

She offered me a translation of the French text to provide context for the lyrics, and then she offered me a license fee:

I really think it’s a lovely tribute to your work and this specific song. That’s why we wanted to keep it in our edition, but I know license has to be asked in order to do so. We typically pay around $60 to be given permission to quote from a song or book, and my editor in chief is more than willing to do for your lyrics. I hope we can work this out together, be assured that we are no Amazon (the mere name makes my teeth itch), just a small publishing house keen on respecting artists’ rights and proud to represent our own authors.
Yours, Léa

I searched online and found that Pushkin Press had published the book in the UK, and replied to Lea that I would answer her license request pending the information I was able to obtain.

I was shocked by her response on April 11, 2023 as follows:

4.
Dear Michelle,
Thank you for your message, I understand. From what I know on our end in France, we must ask for permission because there is no equivalent of “Fair Use”, as in the States, which makes it possible to quote a few lines as in this case. I will keep the edited translation on hold to see whether we keep the quote from “5 A.M. in Amsterdam” or not.
All best, Léa

My surprise was due to the fact that I was well aware that lyric excerpts for publications must be licensed in the US, and do not meet the standards for fair use exception in a commercial use case like this one.

On April 11, 2023 I responded to Lea as follows:

5.
Hi Lea
I have your deadline on my mind, but I am still awaiting a response from Adam at Pushkin Press. I have an instinct that his response will inform my response to you. I promise to keep you notified, and I will send Adam another follow up email this evening.
Thanks for your patience, Michelle

I received a brief reply from the publisher of Pushkin Press, Adam Freudenheim on April 11, 2023 promising to be in contact soon.

Then, to my further surprise, on April 13, 2023 I received a message from Lea as follows:

6.
Dear Michelle,
I’m sorry, I can’t keep the translation on hold any longer, so we’re going to have to delete the lyrics from our print and just keep the reference to your name, song title, and album title. I’m sure the French readers will be curious enough to go buy the album and listen to the song for themselves.
Thank you for time, Léa

My further surprise was due to the fact that this album, The Texas Campfire Tapes, has been OUT OF PRINT SINCE 1996, and further, that my own 2003 independent label reissue of the album, ""The Texas Campfire Takes,"" was withdrawn from ALL distribution in 2013,  currently only available for authorized distribution on my website, https://michelleshocked.com/shop/. 

And then, a few hours later, I received this response, on April 13, 2023, from the assistant editor, Kristen Chapman of Pushkin Press:

7.
Dear Michelle,
Many thanks for reaching out to us. As you say, Pushkin Press published ""I Live a Life Like Yours"" in English translation in the UK in November 2021. We bought rights to publish in the UK from the US publisher, Farrar, Straus and Giroux, and were under the impression that all quoted material in the text either constituted fair use or had already been cleared, however it’s apparent that this wasn’t the case with your song lyrics. My sincere apologies for this oversight. If you’re happy to retroactively grant permission for this usage, we can ensure that an appropriate credit is included in all future reprints of our edition. I attach a searchable PDF so that you can see the quotations in context on pp.135-136. What sort of fee would you suggest for the usage? I Live a Life Like Yours was first published in Norway by Gyldendal Norsk Forlag in 2018. If it would be helpful, I can see if I can locate a contact for you in their rights department.
All best wishes, Kirsten

I was unable to find a contact online for Farrar, Straus and Giroux so I sent a message on April 13, 2023 via their contact form requesting someone contact me regarding the unlicensed use of my work.

I received a response from Milo Walls, associate editor at Farrar, Straus and Giroux on April 17, 2023 as follows:

8.
Dear Michelle,
Our permissions department forwarded your note regarding the use of your lyrics in Jan Grue's memoir. Unfortunately, Jan's editor has since left the company--I'm so sorry there was an oversight. I wonder if you might propose a fee for our use of the excerpt? Do let me know, and thank you.
My best, Milo

I replied to Milo on April 17, 2023 as follows:

9.
Hi Milo
Will you please direct me to counsel regarding this matter? Unfortunately, my situation doesn't allow for a post-use permission and I will need to negotiate a settlement for infringement. I regret that I am unable to be flexible with you at present, but the market for licensing my lyrics is under relentless assault and unfortunately I must maintain a stringent, consistent standard.
Sincere regrets, Michelle Shocked, Campfire Girl Publishing

Milo replied on April 18, 2023 as follows:

10.
Dear Michelle,
Of course. Wendy Szymanski, Associate General Counsel, can advise: wendy.szymanski@macmillan.com
Very best, Milo

I will raise a very tenuous matter of secondary infringement, that is in regard to the distribution of counterfeit vinyl copies of the album, titled ""The Texas Campfire Tapes,"" which was in itself originally released as a bootleg, on which ""Five AM in Amsterdam"" first appeared. I doubt I will be able to provide evidence of causality, but it did catch my attention when Lea Thalmard suggested ""I’m sure the French readers will be curious enough to go buy the album and listen to the song for themselves,"" 

HOWEVER, this website, (Discogs,) currently lists over 350 ""used like new"" (i.e. counterfeit / greymarket) copies of ""The Texas Campfire Tapes"" for sale, (while eBay lists only 64, and I have done the impossible by removing almost if not all counterfeit from Amazon) and I couldn't help but wonder if Jan Grue's publishers were perhaps engaged in some type of 'native' or 'organic' advertising campaign, mentioning my album so evocatively, possibly gratuitiously, in his memoir, in support of greymarket traffickers. It made me wonder if this was not as an 'oversight' at all, but perhaps a deliberate effort to promote counterfeit copies of my album without my knowledge or awareness for more than 5 years? I understand that publishers know more about licensing regimes than anyone else. So why the delay in the licensing request?

I have copy/pasted the listings below because I hope you will see what I am inferring, to get a glimpse at the scope of something I refer to as ""Fraudulent First Sale,"" i.e. unauthorized distribution of unlicensed copyright protected product on third-party online marketplaces:

https://www.discogs.com/sell/item/589305483","I contacted Wendy Szymanski on April 18, 2023 and she replied on April 20, 2023. I proposed a phone discussion and we set up a meeting time to speak at 4:30pm on Monday April 24, 2023. However, she canceled the appointment. 

Given the publishers conduct thus far, I am concerned that they disdain my exclusive copyrights and disregard this infringement as trifling or de minimis, and although I remain hopeful that a mutually satisfactory settlement can be achieved, I assert that this claim causes serious harm to my licensing rights and so seek full statutory relief."
23-CCB-0148,"Shocked v. Chen, et al",https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/2890,"Chen, while employed by Google, uploaded a bootleg recording of my performance of my encore at Yoshi's in San Francisco on March 17, 2013, to her YouTube account, https://www.youtube.com/carolcheny. Her video was titled, ""FULL CLIP: Michelle Shocked Homophobic Rant at Yoshi’s San Francisco"" and was amplified, distributed to YouTube channels such as The Young Turks and David Pakman, within hours. I only discovered the identity of Carol Chen via LinkedIn linkedin.com/in/carolzchen and  https://www.linkedin.com/in/carolhchen in October 2022. The infringement includes my works Wanted Man and Other People, as well as my live performance with spoken word and performance, which I have registered as ""Bootleg This: Truth Vs. Reality.
Chen was the subject of a Case Study by Laurie Honda for danah boyd's Council for Big Data, Ethics, and Society, published April 4, 2016, “It Was A Matter of Life and Death”: A YouTube Engineer’s Decision to Alter Data in the ‘It Gets Better Project’ https://bdes.datasociety.net/council-output/case-study-it-was-a-matter-of-life-and-death-a-youtube-engineers-decision-to-alter-data-in-the-it-gets-better-project/
In this case study, a YouTube engineer [Chen] contemplates whether to subvert engineering best practices to bypass storage capacity limits on videos created for the It Gets Better Project, which aims to prevent self-harm by LGBTQ youth.
It is my reasoning that Chen uploaded this bootleg content to further promote the virality of the It Gets Better Project, which itself was a native advertising campaign on behalf of Google Chrome's new browser launch, marketed by Bartle Bogart Hegarty.","Following the upload of the bootleg recording on Chen's YouTube channel I was 'cancelled', and all tour dates that were booked prior to this were cancelled, and I have been unable to book concert tours since 2013, despite booking and performing on 80+ tour dates in each of the preceeding five years. The losses in my income far exceed the limits of the $30,000 cap for damages here."

23-CCB-0145,Hursey v. The Times of Birmingham Inc / Birminghamtimes.com,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/2829,The Image was used without authorization or license on a publicly front facing website with advertising.,"The claimants primary source of income is through the licensing of photographic imagery.

Bedrock Bowl appeared on Respondent’s website in a black and white collage. 

In addition to copying the images, Respondent altered them or had them altered.  In particular, all four items were converted from color to black and white and cropped for the collage on Respondent’s website, and Respondent overlayed its watermark on the collage containing all four of Claimant's works. Items 2 and 3 were again cropped for the color collage on Respondent's website, and Respondent again overlayed its watermark on the collage containing those two images on the website. It is possible Respondent also augmented the skies and clouds in Claimant's works and/or removed palm trees from her photographs.

Claimant believes Respondent made other unauthorized uses of the works.  In or around July 2021 Claimant inquired about any other uses by Respondent and was told by Respondent's Creative Director, Michael Conejo, that Respondent would ""have to go through a stack of installations and see who ordered that graphic [using Claimant's work(s)] for their center.""  Respondent has not yet provided that information.  

Respondent may have encountered Claimants photographs online (e.g. on Flickr), but Claimant does not yet know with certainty.","Claimant seeks monetary damages based on lost profits from licensing her works and/or from the lack of credit she received in connection with the public uses of her works, as well as disgorgement of Respondent's profits.  Claimant further seeks injunctive relief and attorneys' fees as may be appropriate."

23-CCB-0140,Harm v. Doe,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/2805,"This infringement has occurred on two separate occasions, with each case producing two softbound and one ebook, per incident. 

The counterfeiters used my book to subsequently produce SIX separate works, which constitute SIX separate violations. 

In that the pirates reused all of my photographs without permission each of those SHOLD count as repeated violations. 

Altogether, the pirates created 3 books from my original work, ""Lee Lawrie's Prairie Deco: History in Stone at the Nebraska State Capitol, 3rd Edition,"" I published in September 2011. 

The counterfeits, two softbound books and one eBook, are titled, 
	o (ASIN:B094JPXZRW) - Title: Nebraska State Capitol: The Work Of Lee Lawrie: Nebraska Monuments by Valladares, Beatriz (the ebook)
	o (ASIN:B094LG98Z6) - Title: Nebraska State Capitol: The Work Of Lee Lawrie: Norfolk Nebraska Sculptures by Godnick, Bertha, ISBN 978502005395 (softbound)
	o (ASIN:B094L74P19) - Title: Nebraska State Capitol History: Lee Lawrie's Prairie Deco: Lee Lawrie Sculptor by Ashbrook, Jeremiah, ISBN 9798502016858  (softbound)

A staffer at Bowker, to whom I provided this ISBN to, stated that this number was the property of Amazon, who (likely) resold it to the counterfeiter.

These books were created using my content, including roughly 275 photographs, the majority of which, are my original photos. 

The attachments document the multitude of booksellers, worldwide that offered these pirated copies for sale. 

Both Amazon, who marketed the book globally, and Ingram Spark, who produced the books--have both refused to disclose either who created these works, where they are located, what volume of books were sold.  Most significantly, they have failed to provide any of the revenue that these books likely produced.  And Amazon will no longer respond to my email inquiries. 

This plagiarism was first discovered in on my birthday, on September 15, 202.  Within two weeks, I reported these felonies to the FBI, who after much delay, informed me that they would not investigate the matter.  Their informal explanation was that I had not suffered a sufficient dollar amount for it to be worth their time. 

This claim covers the first episode of my work being plagiarized. 

On the attachment labeled  2nd Round of Counterfeit Books, I provide a .pdf copy of my purchase of the counterfeits that were generated in July 2022, supposedly by authors ""Alfredo Fostervold"" and 'Estela Ravelo."" and an ebooks by ""Love Muncie."" 

These 3 books also used my photographs but they paraphrased my book, rather than to copy it verbatim as did the first two authors. 

Since the FBI allowed Amazon, Ingram, and et al, to get away with these crimes, in June 2022, two MORE counterfeit softbound books, and one new eBook books appeared, for which I will be filing additional claims.","I purchased copies of each of these pirates of my work.   

I inquired of Amazon who created it, and who was ultimately paid for my purchase, but Amazon has refused to provide either the details of the infringer's name, address, number of copies sold, and so on.  It was on sale from May 10-2010 until at least September 15, 2021.  
This action occurred before I registered the copyright, so I understand my rights may be limited or unavailable, however, again AFTER I registered it, Amazon sold additional copies in two books that were infringements.   These will be document in additional claims. Amazon sold the books worldwide on their platforms in UK, Singapore, Dubai and other nations, but never reported any of these sales to me, or whether any occurred.  

I reported this crime to the FBI on September 29, 2021,  and they declined to prosecute it.

I want to seek the maximum penalty available under statute.  In the case of violations under 17 USC 506 and 18 USC 2139, I SHOULD be entitled to statutory damages as outlined in the statute, but specifically for the SECOND instance, AFTER I had already registered my copyright"
23-CCB-0139,Redd v. Gemtracks,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/2804,"Gemtracks is a business that leases and/or sells beats online. From my research, they lure customers in by putting up the work of unsuspecting yet popular musical artists (like myself), and the beats, tempos and art covers of our works, without our permissions. 

The owner of this company, Jesse Neo, says that he's using an API and does not have to take ""my"" art down. My legal and birthname, as well as the art cover and Spotify link are all listed on his site and he's refusing to remove it. 

It is clearly copyright infringement and it is unethical.","Jesse Neo and Gemtracks.com are taking advantage of smaller artists like myself, who may not have the financial means to legally sue for copyright infringment, by posting my art and music up on his/their website to profit from the selling of his beats and/or the ""clout"" my music may bring his site. It is a way to ""appear"" legit. However, I am not financially benefiting from him using my works on his site. Underneath my art cover and song info he's displaying, he is showing an internal ad for customers/viewers to purchase beats for $149 USD. 

I feel cheated as an independent artist, as the music industry does not pay me (us) much money as it is, along with all the gate keeping that goes on to prevent us from reaching higher in the industry. Jesse Neo adds to that frustration via this exploitation of my copywritten art. The fact that he is refusing to take the page down, and even counter-disputing my Google Claims request as well, really hurts me psychologically. He is using my legal name (Ricardo Redd) and my musical brand that I've worked so hard to build, and exploiting it for profit. 

Relief: I would like this page he has on Gemtracks taken down and I would like to receive any compensation that you all - the Copyright Claims Board - find fair and reasonable - so that he does not continue to harm other independent artists like me, who he feels have no power."

Clients pay initial setup fees plus monthly subscription fees for access to sets of FFS videos, which FFS hosts for its subscribers on a commercial video-hosting platform (Wistia.com).  

These licensed clients publicly display and post their set of videos, typically on their public website, in order to educate and engage their customers.  With over 500 active clients, each with a video collection ranging from 2 to 163 different FFS videos, there are tens of thousands of public access points to stream FFS videos.  Examples include:
https://perriottpartners.com/videos/
https://www.titleonecorp.com/video-library
https://www.prescottfinehomes.net/for-sellers/

Selected additional examples can be found on the Web at greystonetitle.com, resultstitle.net, expresstitlecs.com, closingexpress.com, arsetitle.com, southridgeabstract.com, and http://www.micasatitle.com/how-it-works.php

FFS protects its customers, IP and business by providing and requiring video hosting; visitors to a licensed client's website have access only to a stream of the video, rather than a downloadable video file.  (Well-known commercial video services such as Netflix, Disney +, and Amazon Prime also provide video streams rather than video files.)  

FFS' Wistia hosting is configured so that video source download is unavailable (screenshot attached).  FFS does not provide video files to clients, only the streaming access described. All requests from customers to ""get video files"" or ""upload to YouTube"" have been turned down.  Nobody outside the company has technical or legal access to raw video files.

In addition, FFS protects its intellectual property by including Copyright Management Information (as that term is used in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 1202 (the “DMCA”)) that informs viewers that FFS is the owner of the copyrights in the videos, and that lawful uses of its videos required licensing from FFS.  While § 1202 infringement is not a claim subject to determination by CCB, the point is that the videos themselves bear visible notification that the material is copyrighted, that licensing is required, and that all rights are reserved.

FFS has recently discovered that the respondent has illegally made and posted identical copies of 4 FFS videos online:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1TIGXFzVQc

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEWIV1e1pJY

These YouTube streams and FFS Wistia streams are provided in lieu of copies of the master video files, as examples of FFS hosting+streaming protections, and as side-by-side proof that the videos uploaded by the respondent are in fact identical.  The videos distributed by the respondent are not merely ""similar"" — they are identical copies with the same script, voiceover and visuals in every frame.  The Wistia streams and YouTube copies both include the FFS CMI.

The respondent has configured the YouTube player to add a Magna Realty banner graphic on top of the video content, at the bottom-left above the play bar on each video near the end of play. (see J1TIGXFzVQc_closeup.png screenshot)

One online location (""channel"") where the infringing content is publicly displayed is branded ""Magna Realty"". (See Magna Realty YouTube banner.png). It includes multiple videos featuring a person identifying themselves as William Murphey.  

Another online location where infringing content is displayed is https://www.facebook.com/wmurphey/videos; see https://www.facebook.com/wmurphey/videos/10212271333852737.

Hosting a video on YouTube requires uploading a video file (screenshot included).  A YouTube user cannot copy a video into YouTube from a video stream at another service, or from another YouTube stream; access to a video file is required. 

As the only access FFS provides to these works is via streaming, the respondent or some other party had to have circumvented streaming delivery to obtain or reconstruct video files. These illegal copies could not be posted to YouTube without such files. 

Florida Division of Corporations filings identify a for-profit corporation  B. & T. REAL ESTATE SERVICES, INC. William Murphey is listed as an officer.  The principal place of business is listed as 
1451 W CYPRESS CREEK RD STE 300
FT LAUDERDALE, FL 33309.

The creation, distribution and ongoing public availability of these videos violate our copyrights. Respondent has no right to make copies, ignoring the clear copyright and licensing statement visible on each video.  Respondent has no license to distribute copies to promote their business brand.  Respondent has no right to publicly display the videos in their channel, for the benefit and credibility of their business. Respondent has no license to allow the public to perform the works at will by playing them.","Fast Forward Stories' business has been harmed by respondent's infringement in lost revenue, reduced market and substantially increased risk of additional infringement(s).

Respondent could have availed themselves of the content by licensing directly from FFS — in fact, the CMI statement on each video includes the Internet URL where legal licensing could have been arranged.  

By electing to evade protections, copy, upload, display and make the work available for public performance, respondent deprived FFS of the modest fees respondent would have paid to license the content legally.  For the span of time these illegal copies have been publicly available, FFS licensing and hosting fees for respondent based on the date of the first infringing upload would have ranged from $4,012 to $27,132, depending on the set of videos selected and terms arranged.

The public display and ease of free public performance enabled by respondent's illegal posting of the videos on the dominant public video service (YouTube) also harmed FFS by reducing the market for commercial licensing.  Other potential licensees have turned down licensing and payment because ""they could get the same thing on YouTube"", depriving FFS of the opportunity to recoup its substantial investments in research, content design and development, and technical development of a video service. For the span of time these illegal copies have been publicly available, licensing fees for lost customers would have ranged from $4,012 to $27,132 EACH, depending on the choice of services.

YouTube is the most widely-used video hosting service in the world; by uploading these illegal videos to YouTube and choosing to make them publicly available, respondent enabled bypass of FFS' careful anti-download measures.  A web search for 'download video from YouTube' will return over 5 million results. These include numerous free online services that require nothing more than copy-and-paste of the URL of the infringing videos to enable further piracy of the content. The impact on lost licensing fees for FFS is difficult to estimate.

23-CCB-0123,"Kitsap Media Group, dba Experience Kitsap v. Visit Kitsap Peninsula",https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/2629,"Visit Kitsap Peninsula (VKP) has, in a number of instances, used my copyrighted photographic art on their social media pages and website without my permission and without purchasing these images and the rights to publish them on their social media pages and website. Many times, they never even cited me or my business as the source. VKP maintained this practice from at some point in 2018 through late October 2022.

Originally, in March 2021, I discovered VKP was using several of my images on their Instagram page. When an image is uploaded to Instagram, after a week of being uploaded it will display the date of the upload. The earliest dates of the images that VKP uploaded were in 2018. At first, it seemed audacious to see the number of images they were using. I didn't remember giving VKP permission. Given the two ""partnerships"" VKP initiated with me in 2018 and 2020 (See exhibits titled ""Sponsorship that led to VKP creating Kitsap Bites in 2020"" and ""Partnership if I switch to LLC in 2018""), I checked my past emails sent to VKP just to make certain VKP hadn't received any prior permissions to use my images during those times. I did not find any emails of me giving permission to VKP nor do I recall ever giving any verbal permissions.

In March 2021, I made attempts at getting VKP to at least credit the images of mine they were using on their Instagram page. Specifically, I sent Instagram messages and finally an email to their executive director. See exhibit titled ""Email to former VKP Executive Director on March 26 2021,"" which is an email I sent to the former Executive Director Patricia Graf-Hoke that contained a snippet of an Instagram message. I did not receive an email response from the former Executive Director Patricia Graf-Hoke nor anyone on their staff. I eventually received a phone call from the former Executive Director Patricia Graf-Hoke in which she apologized and explained that they would no longer use my images and would remove them (conversation described in the exhibit titled ""Email to new VKP Executive Director on January 13 2022 DMCA Take Down Notice""). Following that conversation with the former Executive Director Patricia Graf-Hoke, I recall seeing many of my images being removed from VKP's Instagram page. It looked as if they were fulfilling their promise to remove all my images. It also seemed that VKP was removing others' images too. At that time, I did not think to take any screenshots of the images that VKP had been using. I had a belief that VKP would uphold their promise of never using my images again. Also, more importantly, I had believed that VKP's use of my images was simply one big mistake on their part and that it was done innocently. Essentially, I gave VKP the benefit of the doubt. In fact, a few months later in Summer 2021, when I applied for lodging tax funding with the City of Bremerton, the City of Bremerton Council member Michael Goodnow asked in a zoom call (recorded by the city if it ever needs to be provided) if I would be willing to partner with VKP. I responded that I would be willing to, and I didn't even mention them poaching my images based on my belief that VKP's picture poaching past was just 'water under the bridge.'

Several months later in January 2022, I checked VKP's Instagram page and noticed some of my images were still on their Instagram page. VKP had gone back on their promise to remove my images. However, some of the images had been updated with credits, acknowledging my Instagram account. Meanwhile, other images of mine did not have any credits. I then checked VKP's Facebook page, which I don't remember doing before, and discovered VKP had some of my images there too (detailed in the DMCA take down exhibit). Given my experience previously in March 2021, realizing VKP hadn't kept to their promise of not using my images, I took screenshots of every single image of mine that remained on their Instagram page, and were being used on their Facebook page. I took copious notes on each image, which I recorded in the DMCA take-down email sent to VKP on January 13, 2022 (see exhibit).

When I discovered VKP was still using some of my images in January 2022, they had already hired a new executive director as the former one had retired. The new VKP executive director was/is named Beth Javens, and since I didn't know her, I really didn't really know how to handle the situation. Also, since VKP didn't seem to honor my past requests, I decided to approach their major funding source - Kitsap County government's Commissioners' office and explained what was going on in hopes they could nudge them in the right direction. The County Commissioners' staff person relayed my concerns to the new VKP executive director Beth Javens (described in the DMCA take-down email). I did that believing that it would make VKP take this matter seriously. I waited for a week, but did not receive a response from the VKP executive director. On January 13, 2022, I emailed the VKP's new executive director Beth Javins and the members of their board. Worth noting, the board members' email addresses were listed on their site. However, some of the emails had come back undeliverable. In my email, I detailed my past experiences with VKP using my images and requested they remove the remaining images from their Instagram and Facebook pages (see exhibit "" Email of DMCA Take Down Notice to new VKP Executive Director on January 13 2022""). My email provided the URL links, a description of each image, and the number of likes and comments each image had on VKP's social media pages. Following the email, I noticed that VKP removed the images that I identified immediately and I verified that each image had been removed. That same day I received an email response from the new executive director Beth Javens. Finally, given the seriousness of my DMCA take-down notice, I truly believed that VKP's picture poaching days would be over.

In the first week of August 2022, I visited VKP's Instagram and Facebook pages, as well as their website to check for images of mine. At the time, I was about to apply for the Kitsap County government lodging tax fund, and wanted to make sure VKP wasn't using any of my images that I might not have discovered before. While I did not find any images of mine on their Instagram or Facebook pages, I discovered VKP was using my Keb' Mo' image as the banner image on their actual website: https://www.visitkitsap.com/entertainment. At first, I didn't recognize the image as being mine because it felt out of context being on their website in such a prominent place as a banner image. I checked my Instagram page, scrolling down to October 12, 2018 and found it was indeed my image (see exhibit titled ""Screenshot of Keb Mo at Experience_Kitsap Instagram page ""). I checked every detail to make certain it was the same image. VKP had, again, gone back on their promise to not use any of my images. Having dealt with two executive directors at VKP and having cc'd the entire VKP Board in my DMCA take-down notice of January 2022, I was at a loss as to what to do regarding this blatant use of my image and their refusal to stop using my images. I soon learned about the copyright claims board and that I needed to get the image registered first. I began the registration process for the Keb' Mo' image on August 24, 2022 and initiated the referral for the copyright claims board on September 5, 2022. I left the image on their website so that the U.S. Copyright could see it when I submitted this complaint. However, due to a cease-and-desist letter received October 25, 2022 (described in the harm suffered section beginning with ""Harm by bullying and intimidating me when I spoke up."")

After receiving the Keb' Mo' registration from the U.S. Copyright Office, I resumed the copyright claims board process. This has been a difficult process, and I have received assistance from two friends in crafting this. I would have submitted this sooner, however, between the emotions in making such a complaint, trying to make certain every statement is verifiable and accurate, and the fact that I work so many hours at my regular job, it's taken me longer than I realized it would to submit this complaint.

Important points:
.
1. Other people have made written allegations against VKP using their Instagram images too. Please note the exhibits titled ""David Nelson editor of Kitsap Sun on VKP using their images"" and ""Visit Poulsbo IG message screenshot."" The Kitsap Sun newspaper and Visit Poulsbo reported that they too experienced VKP allegedly poaching their copyrighted images from their Instagram pages. They both shared that they had complained to VKP about using their images without permission. Visit Poulsbo is associated with the Poulsbo Chamber of Commerce (EIN 91-0839517), while the Kitsap Sun newspaper is part of the USA Today Network. The exhibit titled ""David Nelson editor of Kitsap Sun on VKP using their images"" consists of a screenshot of an email from David Nelson, editor of the Kitsap Sun to the City of Poulsbo on September 1, 2022. The email was part of a long chain of emails between myself and the City of Poulsbo. The exhibit ""Visit Poulsbo IG message screenshot"" consists of one of the Instagram messages between me and Visit Poulsbo on Instagram messaging in October 2022. Following our IG messaging, Shiloh Schroeder and I discussed the matter further by phone and she had explained how the City of Poulsbo's LTAC chair Councilmember Ed Stern asked her group in their LTAC interview what they thought of VKP.  When asked that question by the City of Poulsbo's LTAC Chair, Shiloh Schroeder explained that she informed them that VKP had allegedly poached images from them too (see screenshot exhibit of Instagram messaging). Following our conversation, I immediately emailed the Kitsap Sun newspaper editor and the City of Poulsbo council of this. At that time, my was goal was to get local municipalities to create policies protecting the copyright of creatives like me by ensuring the ethical sourcing of social media content by entities using lodging tax funds.
.
2. My entity started out as a state nonprofit named Kitsap Culture. In 2018, described in the exhibit titled ""Partnership if I switch to LLC in 2018,"" I switched my entity from a state nonprofit to a for profit entity with the name Kitsap Media Group, LLC while doing business as Kitsap Culture. In 2021, switched the dba to ""Experience Kitsap"" while maintaining the entity as Kitsap Media Group, LLC. I am listed with the state as Kitsap Media Group, LLC dba Experience Kitsap and maintain rights with the State of Washington for the names Kitsap Culture and Experience Kitsap. My business' Instagram account is @experience_kitsap (named as @kitsapculture up until Summer 2021), while I have Facebook pages named Kitsap Culture and Experience Kitsap. My business is largely self-funded, with one loyal advertiser. I can afford this because I have a regular job in which I work 50-60 hours a week. My business is my enjoyment outside of work. My pictures are intended to create a positive community for those of us who live here in the Kitsap region of Washington state and to drive this community to my website where I maintain a community calendar. The subject matter of my social media images tends to focus on things that are carefree in nature, happy, informative, and helpful. I regularly do paid boosts on Instagram in order to reach potential followers on social media.
.
3. VKP placed my Instagram images on their Instagram account at @visitkitsappeninsula and their Facebook account at @visitkitsap and finally, the Keb' Mo' image at https://www.visitkitsap.com/entertainment. VKP's use of my images occurred from at least 2018 through to October 2022.
.
4. VKP's past behaviors illustrate a business culture that is okay with copyright infringement and taking advantage of my business. The exhibits titled ""Email to new VKP Executive Director on January 13 2022 DMCA Take Down Notice,"" ""Sponsorship that led to VKP creating Kitsap Bites in 2020,"" and ""Partnership if I switch to LLC in 2018"" contain examples of this behavior. The exhibit titled ""Email with Kitsap County Commissioner Robert Gelder on July 13 2022"" shows the response I received when I tried to explain my trepidation with partnering with VKP.
.
5. Please note, I applied for lodging funds with the City of Bremerton in 2021 and Kitsap County government in 2022. The term ""lodging funds"" refers to funding municipalities provide to entities that operate in a manner that builds tourism (Washington state RCW 67.28.180). Although I was silent on VKP's poaching practices in 2021 when applying to the City of Bremerton's lodging tax fund committee, I was vocal with the Kitsap County commissioners when applying in 2022 to their lodging tax fund after realizing that VKP hadn't changed their poaching practices and because Commissioner Robert Gelder seemed to press me on partnering with VKP.
.
6. The concept of 'fair use' does not quite fit VKP's use of the images, per my perspective. VKP is a 501(c)(6) organization whose primary purpose as a destination marketing organization is to market tourism for Kitsap County, and the cities within Kitsap County that give them funding. VKP's business model is to drive tourism to the Kitsap region through the use of their website and social media pages. Their site and social media pages are an integral part of their tourism marketing campaign, and they rely heavily on these pages to encourage tourists to visit and stay in the Kitsap region. Using attractive imagery is a major part of attracting visitors to one's website and social media pages. The images VKP poached were used in a commercial manner as they annually apply for and rely upon funding from the various LTACs, such as Kitsap County government, for expenses related to photography, digital content, and social media content. VKP used photography, web content, and social media to drive potential tourists to their sites and the websites linked on their pages. VKP maintained contracts and received LTAC funding throughout this process, and does so continuously. While VKP could claim the images were used in an educational manner, neither the Keb' Mo' image nor the Facebook images, previously discovered and mentioned, had any captions that would assist the visitor with being educated. In these instances, the images provided little to no educational value. Therefore, the images are solely used to draw people to visit Kitsap.","Relief I am seeking is explained below:

1. Statutory damages and a portion of any profits VKP made off of my Keb' Mo' image. When I originally initiated this complaint, I had misunderstood the law and didn't quite understand I might be eligible for any statutory requirement. However, if the Copyright Claims Board agrees with my complaint, then I would request they consider granting me statutory damages.

2. I am requesting VKP perform an audit of their digital assets and photographs in a manner that reassures me or confirms to me that they do not have any of my images on their servers that they might inadvertently use in the future. I ask because I know they have had edited versions of my images in the past. See my exhibit of an email to the lawyer titled ""Email to VKP lawyer on November 11 2022 to check servers for image"" that details an image of mine that they edited.

Harm suffered is described below:

1. Harm to Transparency in Government Procurement. When applying for lodging tax funds from the City of Bainbridge Island, City of Poulsbo, City of Bremerton, City of Port Orchard, and the Kitsap County governments, it does not appear that VKP ever informed them that they used my images, nor that they ever allegedly used images belonging to Visit Poulsbo and Kitsap Sun. VKP simply lifted our work and presented it as their own work product for lodging tax fund purposes. Further, VKP has in the past reported their social media statistics without ever informing these municipal governments that these stats were skewed by their unauthorized use of my images.
.
2. Harm to Mental Health. While I wish to give VKP the benefit of the doubt in not truly trying to be malicious or mean, I have experienced depression, anxiety, loss of sleep, and frustration as a direct result of VKP's unauthorized use of my images, especially culminating in the discovery of the Keb' Mo' image. Before the Keb' Mo' image, even though I would discover my images being used on VKP's Instagram and Facebook pages, I handled it with stride. However, discovering the Keb' Mo' image was being used as a major banner image on their website felt like such a blatant show of indifference that I simply could not comprehend why VKP felt entitled to use it without permission, or even offering to purchase from me the rights to use it. I was surprised especially since the former Executive Director Patricia Graf-Hoke was fully aware that I was self-funded. The amount of focus and intention in VKP downloading the Keb' Mo' image from my Instagram account and then cropping it to scale for use on their website and then uploading it to their website was far greater than a simple 'regram' that I had grown accustomed to VKP doing. VKP's brazen determination in using my Keb' Mo' image on their website made me realize that all my prior attempts at getting them to quit using my Instagram images had been futile. I am forced to take prescription medication for anxiety and have, at times, stepped away from posting images for my business simply because I cannot trust VKP to stop committing copyright infringement.
.
3. Loss of time. VKP has proven to me that they are a repeat copyright infringer. Since the Keb' Mo' discovery, I have had to spend my time routinely making sure that VKP isn't using any more of my images on their website and social media pages. While I can't prove it, it is my concern that VKP may have other images of mine that they may have downloaded onto their servers in years past that the current employees and new Executive Director do not know about. If that's true, then it is my concern that at some point VKP will likely inadvertently upload one of my images in the future, considering it to be one of their ""stock images."" VKP seems to have regular turnover in their staff which makes this possibility likely since any such employee wouldn't know the source of any possible ""stock images.""
.
4. Harm to my brand - brand dilution. My uniqueness of photographic art and storytelling represent my personal interests and experiences. Having lived here in the Kitsap region since the mid-1990s, when I arrived in the Navy, I have developed a certain perspective that my social media followers appreciate. Comparatively, while the number of followers across my social media pages is over 33,000 followers, Visit Kitsap Peninsula's followers are far less at around 17,000. Meanwhile, the Kitsap region that we live in has just under 300,000 residents. Given the relatively small population in our area, VKP's use of my images diluted the uniqueness of my brand and this mixing of my images with their images likely benefited them and helped increase their social media engagement. As described in my exhibit on their use of my images in my DMCA take-down notice to VKP, they would place my images on their Instagram page and then tag as many user accounts that they could in order to attract increased engagement, without tagging my account. Their use of my images likely increased the chances of confusion amongst our shared followers. For any new visitors to their pages, the use of my images could potentially have increased the number of their followers. However, without VKP tagging me originally on these posts, no one viewing these images would have known that my business was responsible for the creation of those images.
.
5. Financial harm. VKP unfairly profited off of my work when they posted them in support of their tourism campaign efforts when using lodging tax funds. VKP's use of my images without any user agreement or compensation or licensing has resulted in my business not being compensated. I provided two exhibits of VKP lodging tax applications showing that VKP seeks funding for photographic purposes for marketing expenses (Exhibits VKP LTAC Application 2020 - seeks funds for photography and VKP LTAC Application 2018 - seeks funds for photography). In return, they will seek reimbursement from the municipalities providing invoices from individuals they contract with for photography and post-production in photography. I have not included those because they contain the business names and addresses for these photographers, and don't want to imply that they were involved in any infringement. Upon request of proof that VKP seeks reimbursement, I can provide them.
.
6. Harm by unfair competition. Regarding the lodging tax application process with the Kitsap County government in 2022, I felt wronged when I was denied funding. I had fully explained to the LTAC Chair, Kitsap County Commissioner Robert Gelder, about VKP's history of repeatedly poaching my images for use in their tourism marketing campaigns and even shared the DMCA take-down notice sent to VKP previously in January 2022. None of that seemed to matter to the Kitsap County Commissioners. Meanwhile, VKP never seemed to acknowledge that they used my images, or anyone else's images. To understand what a lodging tax application looks like, view the exhibits titled ""Experience Kitsap 2022 County LTAC Application"" and ""VKP 2022 County LTAC Application.""
.
7. Harm by bullying and intimidating me when I spoke up. When I discovered VKP was using my Keb' Mo' image, I realized that VKP simply had no intention to stop using my images. In order to address their tendency to misappropriate my images, I began in early Fall 2022 to ask our local municipal governments to create policies regarding the images used by VKP. Essentially, I wanted these governments to discourage VKP from using my images by putting into place policies that required them to respect the copyright of creators like me when applying for lodging tax funding. In late October 2022, I received a cease-and-desist letter (see exhibit titled ""VKPs Cease-and-Desist Letter of October 25 2022"") by email from VKP's lawyer (Michelle Q. Pham of Helsell Fetterman LLP, 1001 Fourth Avenue, Suite 4200 Seattle).  Essentially, I was told to stop making such allegations without proof. In my responses, I provided to them and those they cc'd a screenshot of and the metadata associated with my Keb' Mo' picture they were using on their website at that time as a major banner image. The organization immediately pulled the image from their website and their lawyer hasn't bothered me since. As VKP was fully aware that they had poached my images before because of my complaints, they knew that my allegations were true. Therefore, by VKP having their lawyer send me a cease-and-desist letter and cc'ing nearly every elected official I had spoken to, it appeared that they were trying to intimidate me or embarrass me or bully me into silence. VKP's lawyer has not bothered with me since I sent everyone the evidence. The only time we have corresponded since the cease-and-desist email was when I requested she have VKP check their servers for an image I was aware that they had edited and that I wanted it removed if they had it (see Exhibit titled ""Email to VKP lawyer on November 11 2022 to check servers for image."")"

I hope all is well with you. 
We are a video licensing agency, we license our clients content to networks and video marketing websites.
The respondents had uploaded the content without any permission of us or the creator of the video. We reached out to them to clear a license to use the video but they refused. This caused us the loss of 500USD per license per URL (Total: 2000USD).

Given the fact that the respondents is a renowned network, who is very aware of the copyright laws and licensing rules, their copyright team did not cooperate when we reached out to them. Neither their PR team. 

They had so many choices before violating our copyright, they could have just texted our client reaching for his permission (other users have done that) or they could have reached out to us to pay the licensing fees. Or at least they should have accepted the licensing offers we submitted to them. But they insisted on violating our rights and refused to license the content.

The question is: if we or one of our clients has uploaded a sports event owned by ESPN, would it be ok? Of Course not. Same should apply to ESPN distributing our content without permission. 
We are asking for a relief of  1500USD per license per URL. (Total of 4500USD).

23-CCB-0091,Kramer v. Byrd,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/2217,"American University copied the following text, almost in whole, from my copyrighted article:

The ALFA program begins with AU faculty working with the agency director to identify 1-3 difficult organizational challenges along with identifying an executive sponsor for each challenge. AU faculty then meet with each executive sponsor to assess the suitability of the problem for the Action Learning process; clarify the roles of the AU faculty, executive sponsor, and the team members; and provide guidance in selecting an effective Action Learning team. The executive sponsor for each challenge then selects Action Learning teams comprising 6-7 people each.

Days 1-3:The first three days are classroom-based and focused on developing the leadership competencies necessary to utilize the Action Learning methodology. The class will focus on such skills as active listening, asking powerful questions, reflection, strategic thinking, and problem solving. Each team member is required to select one or more personal leadership developmental goals on which to work during the Action Learning process. Participants are challenged to let go of ingrained perceptions of leadership and problem solving - psychic prisons built over the years that limit our mind's ability to see and solve. This part of the program guides students beyond the ability of taking a step away and viewing a leadership challenge from the outside. Instead, it teaches them to observe themselves observing leadership challenges. Furthermore, it embraces unlearning, taboo topics, questioning, and the sheer beauty of simply not knowing. 

Days  4-5:The latter part of the first week, also in the classroom, introduces students to the foundation and structure of the Action Learning model. It is at this point that students begin to couple, in real time, the perceptual changes occurring in Days 1-3, with the structural components of Action Learning, and the context of the identified agency problem(s). By the end of day five, the Action Learning teams have engaged in the necessary steps to fully implement the Action Learning model and have developed a plan for implementation over the next 4-6 months Days 6-10:After the initial week, AU Action Learning coaches attend up to five meetings, at the agency, with the Action Learning Teams. This approach ensures teams maintain consistency in using the Action Learning methodology and refines the leadership skills necessary to properly apply the Action Learning process. As Action Learning Coaches continue to meet with the teams, they work to gauge their progress, review individual leadership competency development plans, and assess future steps. Action Learning teams are encouraged to share what's working along with what is not, and make necessary adjustments. Team members are also encouraged to meet on their own as needed and to consider their Action Learning project as a vehicle for bringing to light their capacity as an extraordinary leader, a learning leader, and a teaching leader. With the guidance of AU faculty and coaches, team members are challenged to reflect periodically on the following questions over the course of the Action Learning project:

Are those on the team growing as human beings?

Are they meeting their developmental goals?

Are they more willing to ask questions about their own values, assumptions, beliefs, and expectations?

Are they increasing their ""headroom""?

Are they more likely to become learning leaders in their own right?

Are they willing to experience negative capability?

Is the team proceeding towards making recommendations to address the identified problem?","I am unable to market my leader development program to Federal agencies in Washington DC because American University uses its weight and imprimatur to market its own program, based almost entirely on my copyrighted article. See pp. 40-41 for the text that American University plagiarized on its web site from my article.

The illegal, derivative copy that was exhibited on THE STREAM had replaced Independent-International Pictures Corp's logo with a CHEESY FLIX logo in front of the credits.  Shoreline requested we remove the copyright strike from their YouTube channel and we told them we don't negotiate with known infringers since they claim they licensed the film from another party called CHEESY FLICKS, who has been infringing and illegally selling digital downloads of Independent-International's copyrighted motion picture Dracula vs Frankenstein on their website, https://www.cheezymovies.com/product-page/dracula-vs-frankenstein-digital.  In turn, SHORELINE / THE STREAM has placed a counter notification to our copyright claim and claim they aired IIP's film by mistake.

Independent-International Pictures Corp. is protecting it's exclusive rights.  Independent-International Pictures Corp. did not grant digital rights to Mainsail LLC., dba Shoreline Entertainment or their digital service The Stream or YouTube or to the company CHEESY MOVIES, aka CHEESY FLICKS ENTERTAINMENT or any of their affiliates.","Independent-International Pictures Corp. has been in the film business for over 50 years and has been actively preserving and distributing its copyrighted motion pictures with legitimate licenses and sales in theaters, television and home entertainment to companies like MGM, Severin Films and Vinegar Syndrome.  Independent-International Pictures Corp. does not want its films exploited in digital as it explores a potential sale of its rights and assets or a guaranteed license fee it deems acceptable.  Continued infringements like those on YouTube by companies like Shoreline's Stream Channel,  and websites like Cheesy Flicks Entertainment aka CHEESY MOVIES, makes it extremely burdensome and nearly impossible for Independent-International Pictures Corp. to maintain and monetize its exclusive rights as it explores a sale or exclusive license of its intellectual properties and assets like Dracula vs Frankenstein.  Independent-International Pictures Corp. is seeking injunctive relief against Mainsail LLC., dba Shoreline Entertainment and their Stream service, as well as Cheesy Flicks Entertainment dba as Cheesy Movies from copying, distributing and exhibiting  its copyrighted motion picture, Dracula vs Frankenstein.  Mainsail LLC is also trying to skirt the infringement by claiming they licensed a different film called Assignment Terror when they clearly had artwork and a derivative copy of Independent-International's Dracula vs Frankenstein made by a company called CHEESY FLIX of Independent-International's copyrighted film.   
In addition, the company CHEESY FLICKS ENTERTAINMENT dba CHEESY MOVIES continues to copy, sell and distriubute unauthorized, derivative versions of the film on their website.  Independent-International Pictures Corp. seeks full damages against each party as the CCB permits."

Defendant uploaded and displayed them on his/her public Youtube channel without permission or authorization from the copyright owner (Plaintiff). Defendant also misrepresented the Plaintiff and Plaintiff's work by pretending to be affiliated with Plaintiff and misusing Plaintiff's brand and image. Defendant infringed on Plaintiff's work no fewer than 42 times. 

Plaintiff filed copyright claims urging Defendant to remove Defendant's more than 42 infringing works. Defendant then filed dozens of copyright counterclaims, forcing Plaintiff into unwanted litigation.","As a result of Defendant remixing and reposting Plaintiff’s songs online, Plaintiff has suffered harm in the form of lost profits from unauthorized use of Plaintiff’s creative work, damage to Plaintiff’s reputation as an entertainer/musician/entertainment company, and loss of control over the distribution and monetization of Plaintiff’s intellectual property. Plaintiff further claims that Defendant's actions devalued the original songs/music videos and caused harm to Plaintiff’s ability to commercially exploit the work as Plaintiff intended.

Plaintiff is seeking injunctive relief prohibiting Defendant from continuing to use Plaintiff’s copyrighted material or image on Youtube and other platforms, as well as keeping the content at issue from being reinstated to YouTube by Youtube. Plaintiff also respectfully requests that the Court award all costs and expenses associated with this action, including reasonable attorney's fees, to be paid by the Defendant. Plaintiff contends that Defendant's actions, including but not limited to copyright infringement, have caused substantial harm and damage to Plaintiff's rights as a copyright owner.
Plaintiff further argues that the Defendant's actions have been willful, knowing, and intentional, and that Defendant's conduct has been aimed at commercial gain at Plaintiff's expense. Plaintiff believes that the award of attorney's fees and legal costs is necessary to fully compensate Plaintiff for the harm caused by Defendant's infringing conduct, and to deter Defendant and others from engaging in similar conduct in the future.
Plaintiff respectfully submits that it is entitled to an award of attorney's fees and all legal costs under applicable law, and requests that the Court grant this request in full."

23-CCB-0073,Erwin v. Meyer,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/2122,"On October 28, 2022 Rakeem Calief Myer, using the professional name “Roc Marciano” knowingly infringed on my copyrighted music and performed a live performance and created a video of the live performance for distribution on YouTube.
Mr. Myer knowingly and intentionally did this, as he was fully aware that the song, he was sampling was written and fully copyrighted by me.
The song of mine, that Mr. Myer sampled for his derivative product (Thugs Prayer) is entitled “Trip Thru Hell Part 1”.  It is from my 1969 album entitled “Trip Thru Hell” (also released on a 1995 CD by Sundazed records and registered with the pre1972 recordings of the Library of Congress) It can also be located on our YouTube channel https://youtu.be/_mLkm1nMJXs
The copyright for this song contained on the album was registered May 14, 2019. (attachment)
Mr. Meyer committed this infringement knowing full well he had no right to perform this derivative he calls “Thugs Prayer” live and then place a video of the performance on YouTube.
This infringement occurred just days after an attorney representing Mr. Myer failed to respond back to me after six months of negotiations failed to enabled Mr. Meyer to obtain a license to use my song in his derivative (Thugs Prayer).
The negotiations with his attorney went from April 2022 until early October1922. 
His attorney ceased communications after I pointed out that (for one thing) I was unable to lawfully make an agreement with Mr. Meyer’s LLC as they stated the LLC was located in California when in fact, I discovered the LLC was registered in New Jersey (attached)
To best illustrate the infringement of Mr. Myers, I have attached a third-party YouTube video of Mr. Myers’ “Thugs Prayer” played right after my song “Trip Thru Hell Part 1”.  I recorded this in June 2022 and subsequently had it removed for copyright violation. (attached)
 After failing to negotiate a license, on October 28th, Mr. Meyer under his professional name “Roc Marciano”, performed his derivative song” Thugs Prayer” live and created a video which he later placed on his YouTube channel. 
I recorded of a portion of the “live performance video” he made before I had YouTube remove it. In the video you can hear my song being played as he rapped over it. (attached 4)
The live performance video was uploaded on two different YouTube channels and I discovered them on Jan 5, 2023
One channel was called “Prison Mike” (the channel from which I recorded my copy of the video)
The other channel belonged to Mr. Meyer, and he calls the channel ” Roc Marciano The Movie@rocmarcianothemovie” https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjELk3BwOCSi_tZ7LVlkN7Q  
I had the “live performance video” removed by YouTube and have attached the copyright notification on my channel notifying that it has been taken down (attached)
This latest incident demonstrates that Mr. Myer has no intention of respecting my copyrights or the copyright laws of the United States.

I also included two music sample/clips ....one of the illegal sampling by Roc Marciano called ""Thugs Prayer"" and the my original copyrighted song called ""Trip Thru Hell Part 1"" by the C.A, Quintet","I am seeking maximum statutory damages, the costs of this action and such other amounts as the Court deems proper and within the limit authorized by this Court.  
The respondent’s acts of infringement were not only willful, intentional, and purposeful, but also in complete disregard of and indifference to claimants’ rights. Accordingly, claimant is entitled to judgment in its favor and against each respondent, jointly and severally, for statutory damages, in the discretion of the Board, plus interest, and costs.
By failing to obtain Petitioner’s authorization to use the Copyrighted Work or to compensate Petitioner for their various uses, The respondent has avoided payment of license fees and other financial costs associated with obtaining permission to exploit the Copyrighted Work, as well as the restrictions that Petitioner is entitled to and would place on any such exploitation as conditions for Petitioner’s permission, including the right to deny permission altogether
 The respondent has certainly gained an undeserved and unknown amount of revenue/profit from the derivative by exploiting my original music.
This has caused an immeasurable amount of damage, damaging credibility, sullied my original work and required many hours to identify the source and scope of the infringement as well as the parties/respondents (thus far identified) involved. 
The creation and exploitation of the unauthorized derivative work also has induced, facilitated, and encouraged further downstream infringement.   
Until a settlement agreement (if any) is signed, I reserve the right to require different and/or additional terms and conditions to settle this matter.
And, unless and until a settlement is signed, I reserve all of my rights and remedies and Rakeem Calief Myer, using the professional name Roc Marciano has no rights to use any portion of my recordings and compositions."

On January 25, 2023, Claimant’s counsel sent a cease and desist letter to Respondents objecting to Respondents’ unauthorized distribution of the Infringing Works. See, Exhibit 9. To date, Claimant has received no response to its cease and desist letter and, after reasonable inquiry, has no evidence that Respondents have complied with the demands set out in Claimant's counsel's cease and desist letter.","As a result of Respondents’ actions described above, Claimant has been directly damaged, and is continuing to be damaged, by the unauthorized distribution and public display of the Infringing Works.

Respondents Lavell Naquon Bynum and Takela Corbitt had a right and ability to supervise the activities of the Establishment on the date of the Program and had an obvious and direct financial interest in the activities of the Establishment on the date of the Program.

Prior to the broadcast of the Program, Respondents could have contracted with Claimant and purchased authorization to exhibit the Program in the Establishment for a fee.  However, Respondents chose not to contract with Claimant or pay the fee to Claimant to obtain the proper license or authorization. At no time did Claimant give Respondents license, permission or authority to receive and exhibit the Program in the Establishment.

Instead, Respondents, including their agents, servants, and/or employees, took affirmative steps to circumvent the commercial licensing requirement and unlawfully obtained the Program and exhibited it in their Establishment. 
 
Upon information and belief, Respondents willfully engaged in illegal acts to receive the Program for free or at nominal cost while Claimant’s legitimate customers paid several thousand dollars.  Respondents knew, or should have known, their receipt and exhibition of the Program at their establishment was not authorized.

Upon information and belief, Respondents intentionally pirated the Program for the sole purpose of their own economic gain. Respondents exhibited the Program for the commercial purpose of attracting paying customers, patrons, members, and guests, thereby wrongfully benefiting financially by infringing Claimant’s rights in the Program.

Respondents did not have license, authorization, permission, or consent from Claimant to exhibit the Program in the Establishment.

As exclusive licensee of the Program, Claimant has standing and capacity to bring this action in its own name against Respondents for their violation of the Copyright Act.

Respondents’ unauthorized display and public performance of the Program through any means was in violation of 17 U.S.C. §§ 106 and 501.

Respondents’ acts of infringement were not only willful, intentional, and purposeful, but also in complete disregard of and indifference to Claimant’s rights.

Accordingly, Claimant is entitled to judgment in its favor and against each Respondent, jointly and severally, for statutory damages, in the discretion of the Board, plus interest, costs and attorneys’ fees.","Claimant seeks statutory damages in the discretion of the Board, of up to the maximum amount of $15,000.00 for the Respondents’ willful violation of 17 U.S.C. § 501 and for Claimant’s attorney’s fees, interest, and costs of proceedings."

After I noticed that we reported the channels for Infringement the response from “In Slime we Trust” was to contact his lawyer and I passed that on to YouTube, He claimed that he was using “Fair Use” which would have been true if he didn’t say “She wrote” in the video implying that I am producing information that is false during the original video, and implying that people could find me by searching for my IP address and then finally insinuating that I work for Wikipedia and I had no proof of what was posted on Wikipedia and that it was invalid.

At the same time the channel BadBoyBreeze was sending threats over the comments section of YouTube and even posting video’s about how he is going to come for me and that I need to be ready.

I filed a civil rights complaint at DOJ.gov Complaint Record number 257523-RHH

After YouTube refused to back me up with my copyrights and also I was unable to secure an interview with the Daily Mail in Australia and I warned YouTube that these false allegations about me where going around it was hurting my career. Comments such as “there is a hospital waiting for you” “It’s the fourth have you had your period yet.”

All they did was give me the run around with a bunch of dead end go start from scratch and fill out another privacy form.
Then the cyber bullies went over to Twitter and started saying that I was a mental case, and started talking about my prescriptions that I am taking. I did start a complaint with Twitter but even with the above practices why are these companies allowed to ignore my cease and desist letter’s and why are they making it so difficult for me to file complaints about copyright infringement and cyber bullying when I am a disabled person and I am a protected class yet I have to go the extra mile. Why are they putting aan additional hardship on a disabled person all the while allowing people to bully, harass, and label me online using defamatory words. I copyrighted #Stellaroseallday and for anyone to be able to tag me they must pay me to use that with a license. That’s the way it is set up “For Hire” and they can’t bully me into accepting what they think is right. Legally no-one can use that hashtag but me unless they pay for it.",Loss of income due and smear campain is damaging my professional reputation that I have been building since 2011.

Prior to this, the market was dominated by blue sky and white clouds background, plus yellow building site patterns. The above information can be found by searching for construction paper plate products on the Amazon e-commerce platform and confirming the release time.

After the design is completed, we published it on the Amazon e-commerce platform on October 18, 2021. The product link is https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JNX92Q9, everyone can visit and buy our products.

After the design of our black and yellow architectural tableware is completed, in 2022, there are many imitated products on the market. The respondent is one of the imitators. The respondent - guang zhou shi bo qing bo mao yi you xian gong si   owns and operates the online marketplace account identified by the https://www.amazon.com/sp?ie=UTF8&seller=A1QJFZNXCF3ZR1 and the Account Name Boqbo(“Online Marketplace”). 

The product (ASIN-B0BNZWRN2M) sold online in the above Amazon store plagiarized our product pattern design ideas, see below for details.

Infringement points:
The main infringement pattern of B0BNZWRN2M is a large-sized plate.
1. Basically the same as our product, with yellow and black color schemes, a building silhouette background, and yellow and black warning tape around it. The middle pattern mainly highlights the three main elements of excavators, tower cranes, and warning road signs.
2. The position of each pattern and the overall layout creativity are consistent with ours.","It infringes on our product design. Due to the high similarity in appearance, customers are prone to cognitive bias when they are sold on the same platform. On the premise that product quality cannot be guaranteed, it will have a certain impact on our brand and store reputation.

Our monthly sales of this product are about 25,000 US dollars. Due to the infringement of the respondent, we have increased our investment in obtaining Amazon traffic and damaged our sales. Caused a loss of at least 25,000 US dollars. Since Amazon removed the other party's link, we have no way of finding out the profit the respondent made from the sale.
We have complained to the respondent on the Amazon e-commerce platform, and Amazon has temporarily removed the respondent's link, but the other the respondent's counter-appeal requires Amazon to restore the link within 10 working days.
We hope that the respondent will stop the infringing behavior, permanently delete their selling links, and promise not toinfringe our copyright again."

Each Infringing Design utilizes the same color scheme and occupation or role of each Program Character. By way of example, the Program Character Chase is a police dog. In connection with the Program, he is depicted wearing a navy uniform, with matching navy hat. His badge consists of a yellow star shape on a navy background. Shirt Traveler’s corresponding Infringing Design, titled “Age Memory Police Dog Number Series,” incorporates the color navy, a navy police officer’s hat, and badge consisting of a yellow star shape on a navy background. Id. Additionally, Shirt Traveler offers for sale apparel featuring the Program logo. Id. Shirt Traveler’s Infringing Design replaces the word “PAW” with the word “Dad,” “Sister,” or “Mom.” The Infringing Design is otherwise identical to the Program logo. 

Attached as Exhibit 3, please find a side-by-side comparison of the Characters and the Infringing Designs.

Despite owning no copyright rights in or to the Program or Characters, on December 8, 2022 and on December 10, 2022, Shirt Traveler responded by submitting a counter-notice. See Exhibit 4. 

Spin Master and VII have learned that, in addition to selling and/or offering for sale products featuring the Infringing Designs, Shirt Traveler has also improperly obtained copyright registrations for five of its Infringing Designs. See Exhibit 5. While each Infringing Design expressly references the color scheme, and job or role, of its respective corresponding Program Character, the title of each Infringing Design submitted to the Copyright Office appears to have been deliberately selected to avoid use of the corresponding character name.

Shirt Traveler continues to sell and/or offer for sale apparel featuring the Infringing Designs through its website.","Shirt Traveler’s actions falsely suggest to both parents and children that apparel and other consumer products featuring the Infringing Designs are affiliated with, or approved and endorsed by, Spin Master and/or VII. 

Shirt Traveler continues to sell and/or offer for sale products featuring the Infringing Designs willfully, in knowing disregard and violation of Spin Master’s copyright rights.

After the design of our black and yellow architectural tableware is completed, in 2022, there are many imitated products on the market. The respondent is one of the imitators.

The respondent - jinhuashixichunzhizhipinyouxiangongsi owns and operates the online marketplace account identified by the Amazon account amazon.com/sp?seller=A3QDRZFO6775LJ and the Account Name tangpiao (“Online Marketplace”).

Infringement points:
The main infringement pattern of B0BJQGNS89 is a large-sized plate.
1. The overall effect of the pattern is consistent with ours, with yellow and black color schemes, a building silhouette background, and a yellow and black warning tape around it. The middle pattern mainly highlights the three main elements of excavators, tower cranes and warning road signs.
2. The pattern design is very similar with us: the design of the silhouette of the building in the background, the pattern of the excavator and the tower crane.
3. The position of each pattern and the overall layout creativity are consistent with ours.","Our monthly sales of this product are about 25,000 US dollars. Due to the infringement of the respondent, we have increased our investment in obtaining Amazon traffic and damaged our sales. Caused a loss of at least 25,000 US dollars. Since Amazon removed the other party's link, we have no way of finding out the profit the respondent made from the sale.
We have complained to the respondent on the Amazon e-commerce platform, and Amazon has temporarily removed the respondent's link, but the other the respondent's counter-appeal requires Amazon to restore the link within 10 working days.

23-CCB-0035,"Comedy Spotlight Productions, Inc. v. Store on Sunset LLC, et al",https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/1865,"COPYRIGHT:

Comedy Spotlight Productions, Inc. (“Claimant”) is the beneficial owner of the copyright of the motion picture titled “One Night with Dice” (hereinafter “the Work”).  (See U.S. Copyright Registration No. PA0000409262; March 16, 1989)

BACKGROUND OF THE WORK:

The Work is an approximately 46-minute video featuring a recording of a live stand-up comedy performance by a Comedian.  Taped at Philadelphia’s Comedy Factory Outlet in 1986, it is a rare recording from the early stage of the Comedian’s career before he went on to achieve national name recognition.  Upon initial release by Vestron Video (then a subsidiary of Vestron, Inc.), the Work reached #2 on the Billboard Video Chart - bested only by a video release from Sir Paul McCartney himself.  This instant success was remarkable considering the Work’s VHS list price at the time ($59.99) and a complete absence of any promotional and marketing activities to generate audience interest in the Work. 

Upon expiration of the agreement between Claimant and Vestron Video in 2002, Rhino Entertainment Co. (“Rhino”), a subsidiary of Warner Bros., quickly stepped forward to acquire distribution rights to the Work.  In 2009, an Australian film distribution company, Umbrella Entertainment, sought out Claimant to acquire rights to distribute the Work in Australia and New Zealand – territories not covered by the Rhino agreement.  Right after the Rhino deal expired, Netflix became interested, and as a part of that deal, recommended eOne Entertainment as a distributor (eOne Ltd., currently a subsidiary of Hasbro, Inc.).  eOne Entertainment secured rights starting in 2012.  Comedy Dynamics, a subsidiary of The Nacelle Company, is currently the exclusive Licensee of the Work and is known as a leading U.S. and international distributor of stand-up comedy specials.  Claimant remains the beneficial owner of the Work under the terms of the licensing agreement with Comedy Dynamics (the Licensee).

In short, the Work was an instant and undeniable hit and -  having never been out of distribution -  has maintained its entertainment value and commercial viability ever since its initial 1991 release.  For obvious reasons, Claimant considers the Work an extremely valuable intellectual property asset.   

STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS:

Respondents produced a five-part documentary series entitled The Comedy Store (the “Series”).  Upon information and belief, the Series was initially released on the Showtime television network on October 4, 2020. (See Exhibit 1)  The Series is currently available for purchase on the online retail website Amazon.com, the online streaming service Hulu and be viewed via numerous other online streaming services. (See Exhibits 2, 3, 4).  Episode Three of the Series concerns how the Comedian’s jokes regarding a particular minority community likely damaged his career.  Episode Three features various clips taken directly from the Work.  Meanwhile, the Work itself is also still available for viewing through numerous online streaming services. (See Exhibits 5, 6, 7, 8).  

Claimant has posted a true and accurate copy of Respondents' unauthorized use of parts of the Work on the video hosting website Vimeo.  Claimant’s Vimeo post is a copy of a segment that starts at approximately 33 minutes and 39 seconds into Episode Three and can be accessed at the following web address: https://vimeo.com/789319068 .

As shown in the Vimeo post, Episode Three features a clip of the late comedian Bob Saget discussing the Comedian’s career in which he states that “All I remember is that it was a fast drop off.” 

Next, director and producer of the Series, Mike Binder, states:  “He makes all these… jokes.” 

Following Mr. Binder’s statement, Episode Three includes a clip, taken directly from the Work, showing the Comedian confessing: “I don’t see how any man can look… [explicit material deleted]…, you know?” (hereinafter ""the Work's Confession Clip"").

Episode Three then immediately transitions to another clip - also taken directly from the Work. This clip features a recording of the Comedian’s live performance of an entire joke (“the Joke”), from beginning to set-up to punchline.  The recorded performance of the Joke starts with “And they’re always on parade…” and concludes with a punch line of “Get a job [expletive deleted]!”

The recorded performance of the entire Joke taken from the Work is incorporated in Episode Three as is, meaning that Respondents did not add any other material, such as background music, visual effects or voice-over commentary. 

In September of 2021, a representative of the Work’s current Licensee spoke to Jonathan Vogler, V.P. at Respondent Mandalay Sports Media, concerning the inclusion of parts of the Work in Episode Three without authorization. The current Licensee then received a letter, dated October 11, 2021, from the legal representative of Respondent Store on Sunset LLC.  The October 11th letter provided an analysis in support of a Fair Use defense to any claim of copyright infringement with regard to Respondents' copying of the Work.  

DESCRIPTION OF HARM & RELIEF SOUGHT:

Claimant hereby asserts that the reproduction of the recorded performance of the entire Joke in Episode Three does not constitute Fair Use in any way.  As such, Respondents' unauthorized incorporation of the recorded performance of the entire Joke in Episode Three infringed on Claimant’s copyright of the Work.  Given that both the Series and the Work can currently be purchased from numerous online streaming services, Claimant wishes to protect the current and potential market for the Work, an intellectual property asset with a proven 33-year record of commercial value in the entertainment industry.  Claimant seeks relief of $15,000.00 in damages for Respondents' copyright infringement.

As shown in TCA TV Corp. v. McCollum (839 F.3d 168 (2d Cir. 2016), the verbatim incorporation of a joke can be deemed as not Fair Use.  In TCA, a character (“Jason”) in a Play performs Abbot & Costello’s “Who’s on First” routine acted out between Jason and a sock puppet controlled by the Jason character. Of note, the TCA court stated that a “critical inquiry is whether a new work uses copyrighted material itself for a purpose, or imbues it with a character, different from that for which it was created.” 

The Respondents in TCA argued that their use of the routine was for a dramatic purpose – not a comedic one – serving as a theatrical device setting up the moment the sock puppet takes on its own persona in order to call out Jason for lying about being the originator of the “Who’s on First” routine.  The TCA court stated that while Jason’s act of lying itself had a dramatic purpose, the particular subject of that lie (i.e. the “Who’s on First” routine) did not.  To that end, the TCA court further stated that the Play appropriated the Routine’s humor and that no new dramatic purpose was served by so much copying.

The October 11th letter stated that copying the Work supported a discussion of legitimate public concern and interest and, thus, is a transformative use.  But Respondents already showed an example of the Comedian’s alleged offensive humor with the Work's Confession Clip.

The Work's Confession Clip is immediately followed by the unauthorized reproduction of the recording of the Comedian’s live performance of the entire Joke. Respondents even copied the set-up line right before the Joke’s “Get a job…” punch-line.  Having already allegedly supported Respondent’s discussion of legitimate public concern by showing the Work's Confession Clip – no new purpose was served by so much copying of the Comedian’s entire performance of the Joke.  For example, inclusion of the performance of the set-up line “I want money for a [expletive deleted] car, I’m not marching up and down the street!,” serves no purpose in Episode Three of the Series other than its original purpose – which is to show a viewer the Comedian live, on stage, literally setting up the Joke’s “Get a job…” punch-line.  This is the essence of the live comedic performance captured by the Work and, as such, Respondents appropriated the recorded performance of the entire Joke and failed to imbue the entire Joke’s performance with a character, different from that for which it was created.","Respondents' incorporation of the Work's recorded performance of an entire joke in Episode 3 of the Series does not amount to Fair Use. Hence, Respondents have infringed on Claimant's copyright. Claimant seeks $15,000.00 in damages."

Commercial businesses such as the business made the basis of this suit were not authorized to receive and exhibit any of the Programs in their commercial business without authorization from Claimant.

Respondents Tilly Jane’s, LLC and Lucas Ward (collectively the ""Respondents"") owned, operated, maintained, and controlled the commercial business known as Tilly Jane’s Sports Bar & Grill located at 1803 12th Street, Hood River, OR 97031 (the “Establishment”) on the dates of the Programs.

Respondent Lucas Ward is an individual who resides in the State of Oregon and was a member, manager, officer and/or principal of the entity owning and operating the Establishment on the dates of the Programs.  Respondent Lucas Ward had a right and ability to supervise the activities of the Establishment on the dates of the Programs and had an obvious and direct financial interest in the activities of the Establishment on the dates of the Programs.

Prior to the broadcasts of the Programs, Respondents could have contracted with Claimant and purchased authorization to exhibit each of the Programs in the Establishment for a fee.  However, Respondents chose not to contract with Claimant or pay the fees to Claimant to obtain the proper license or authorization. At no time did Claimant give Respondents license, permission or authority to receive and exhibit any of the Programs in the Establishment.

Instead, Respondents, including their agents, servants, and/or employees, took affirmative steps to circumvent the commercial licensing requirement and unlawfully obtained each of the Programs and exhibited it in their Establishment. 
 
Upon information and belief, Respondents willfully engaged in illegal acts to receive the Programs for free or at nominal cost while Claimant’s legitimate customers paid several thousand dollars.  Respondents knew, or should have known, their receipt and exhibition of the Programs at their establishment was not authorized.

Upon information and belief, Respondents intentionally pirated the Programs for the sole purpose of their own economic gain. Respondents exhibited the Programs for the commercial purpose of attracting paying customers, patrons, members, and guests, thereby wrongfully benefiting financially by infringing Claimant’s rights in the Programs.

Respondents did not have license, authorization, permission, or consent from Claimant to exhibit any of the Programs in the Establishment.

As exclusive licensee of the Programs, Claimant has standing and capacity to bring this action in its own name against Respondents for their violations of the Copyright Act.

Respondents’ unauthorized display and public performance of each of the Programs through any means was in violation of 17 U.S.C. §§ 106 and 501.

Respondents’ acts of infringement were not only willful, intentional, and purposeful, but also in complete disregard of and indifference to Claimant’s rights.

Accordingly, Claimant is entitled to judgment in its favor and against each Respondent, jointly and severally, for statutory damages, in the discretion of the Board, plus interest, costs and attorneys’ fees.","Claimant seeks statutory damages in the discretion of the Board, of up to the maximum amount of $30,000.00 for the Respondents’ willful violations of 17 U.S.C. § 501 and for Claimant’s attorney’s fees, interest, and costs of proceedings."

They did not properly notify my account of this video being used, seemingly intentionally leaving a space between the @ and my username (@ deardanes) so that it would not notify me that this video was used. They also did not ask permission to use, nor utilize Instagram's features of tagging or collaborating on reels. 

I filed a copyright infringement form on November 3rd, 2022, requesting that Instagram remove the video.

Pets on Q is a platform who's entire purpose is to ""enable collaboration among our vetted pet influencers & set animals with brands and agencies through expert technology and services. We bring the key assets of advanced influencer search, pricing analysis, and full campaign management."" 

Since their platform seeks to pay influencers and social media managers for the content that they create, I had reached out to Colleen Wilson on September 4, 2022, inquiring about a paid collaboration for a DNA Pet Company. Colleen replied on September 8, 2022, stating: ""Your account is so great! I am a huge fan of people that foster like this. 

I passed your email off to the salesperson on our team managing the DNA campaign. I do believe they have made selections but it never hurts to ask. 

What are your rates? I will pass that along too.

Thank you,"".  This email reply implies that Colleen was aware that I charged for my content.  Between September 8th-9th, emails were exchanged that Colleen informed me that the DNA brand  ""said you are not in their budget at this time. That’s based on your initial quote with them so they have passed and made other selections."" but that ""We have LOADS coming in for the holiday season so stay tuned and log into our platform and community where we will post any open casting calls"", again further implying her awareness that I do charge for others to use my content. 

I am a full-time content creator that am under contractual obligations with other agents. By Pets on Q illegally using my content on their platforms, millions of people got the impression that I am represented by Pets on Q, when in fact I have never signed any agency work with Pets on Q.

Additionally, later in the week after Colleen posted my video illegally, she proceeded to share a story on Instagram about how baffling it is that brands do not pay their content creators. However, I was never offered monetary payment for my video. In the video it states 'Know your worth. Respect your time. Never work for free"".

I am seeking damages of $30,000 for loss of revenue, as when other agencies inquired to reach out about partnerships, they were negated due to the impression that I was already with Pets on Q as my hiring agency."

Hi Ivy,

 

Legally speaking the work I did was not beyond my “scope.”  That’s not even an accurate assessment.

 

I am a licensed attorney. I have experience in litigation, trademark law, and the CDA, as that is a Federal Statute that comes up regularly in my work.

 

Under the model rule 1.1  for ethics for attorney’s we are perfectly capable of evaluating the facts of a case to determine, which is what we did. I am an attorney, whether or not you believe I am competent is irrelevant. I would advise you not to continue to insinuate suggest otherwise.

 

You do not have a claim under the CDA. Moreover, our entire team of attorneys worked on your matter and evaluated the facts and law.

 

Regards,

Ravi Varma

Google monetize my YouTube channel and has not provided any payments to me. Instead, I receive the same email weekly asking for updated tax and bank account details ( which have never changed) so Google never accepts the information I submit, and therefore, I have not receievd a payment from Google AdSence for YouTube in years.

Having the entire working copy of the video, the third parties replaced my image and voice with another person asking the same questions as in the original record. I shall underline that the interview questions have been prepared by myself only. Further, the infringement occurred when illegally modified video has been published on different channels online by means of the online service provider (YouTube and Google).
In addition, I attract your attention to the fact that the infringement of YouTube is confirmed by the partial removal of infringing materials leaving the part of it publicly available.

https://doi.org/10.1186/s13054-021-03622-5


I am filling this complaint for the reasons below:

1)	The company removed my name from the manuscript as retaliation because I left the company
2)	The authors have taken my work and claimed this is their work 
3)	They used my name in the acknowledgment section without my consent or giving me any chance to verify the contents of the manuscript
4)	The manuscript contains some parts that are not true

For the details, please see the attached files.

There are four parties involved with the violation 1) Beckman Coulter, Inc, a US-based company and its representative Liliana Tejidor, 2) Pierre Hausfater, the first author, Emergency Department, Hôpital Pitié-Salpêtrière, APHP-Sorbonne Université, France, 3) Journals Medicine & Life Sciences, Spring Nature Publication, and 4) Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE).

I am filing a claim against the US-based party; I will file claims or go for lawsuits with non-US-based parties separately.","It is beyond imagination how stressful this is! I am a young researcher. Every work of mine is hard-earned, and it is very disappointing to see that these veteran researchers stole my work and claimed that this is their work. I tried to solve this in many ways. They either ignored me or pretended that it was very normal to steal someone’s work. It is their mercy whether I will get anything out of my hard work.

I contacted the corresponding authors and the Beckman representative, Liliana Tejidor. Liliana Tejidor is not a corresponding author, but she is responsible for all decisions for this kind of project as a company representative. The corresponding author is nothing but a hired researcher only. 

I have been trying to resolve the issue since June 30, 2021. I reached out to the author, but they did not want to solve the issue. Then I reached out to the journal. The Journal asked them to solve the issue but showed them how to just include my name nominally without giving me proper credit for my work. According to the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) and the Journal guidelines, the journal must demonstrate neutrality which it failed to show. The editor appeared to have a personal relationship with the authors and used that to make the decisions. 

Then I reached out to the COPE. COPE asked for more clarification on this dispute and only recommended the journal to send the manuscript dispute to the authors' institution; however, I found that COPE did not take into account my evidence at all. The decision was solely based on what the journal had responded to. They did not provide further clarification, although I sent an email to COPE. Also, the journal did not follow the COPE’s recommendation either and did not send back the dispute to the institution.

It has been almost a year and a half. It is so stressful and time-consuming. I have a full-time job and a family with two little kids. Whenever I reach out to them, they provide me with very little information or completely ignore me. So far, I have spent approximately 400 hours on this issue, including drafting the dispute, communicating with the parties, and responding to the emails, in addition to so much stress, which is beyond anyone's imagination."

22-CCB-0245,"Say It Visually, Inc v. America's Real Estate Force Corporation",https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/1239,"Say It Visually, Inc. d/b/a Fast Forward Stories (“FFS”) is the creator and owner of the copyrights in various “explainer” videos that it produces and licenses to its clients. Clients pay initial setup fees plus monthly subscription fees for access to various FFS videos, which FFS typically hosts for its subscribers on a commercial video-hosting platform. FFS protects its videos by providing video hosting, whereby visitors to a subscriber’s website have access only to a stream of the video, rather than a copy. Hosting is configured so that video source download is unavailable.

FFS has recently discovered that the respondent has illegally made and posted copies of FFS property online, including at least the following:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuM6_JEmwuY
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ko2HFBvCa9s
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHJVgkdsFAI
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXdoFKAxeAA
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY6lI4-UvFs

The creation, distribution and ongoing public availability of these videos violate our copyrights. Respondent has no right to make copies, ignoring the clear copyright statement visible on each video.  Respondent has no license to distribute copies to promote their business brand.  Respondent has no right to publicly display the videos in their channel, for the benefit and credibility of their business. Respondent has no license to allow the public to perform the works at will by playing them.

Among other measures, FFS protects its intellectual property by including Copyright Management Information (as that term is used in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 1202 (the “DMCA”)) that informs viewers that FFS is the owner of the copyrights in the videos, and that particular lawful uses of its videos have been licensed by FFS. 

These illegal copies also violate the provisions of the DMCA that prohibit the distribution of false Copyright Management Information (i.e., the material on each video representing that respondent licensed the content from FFS, when in fact respondent has not licensed the content).  Each distribution of each such video (i.e., each upload and each download) is also a violation of the DMCA.  See DMCA § 1203(c)(3)(B).  

Additionally, these videos appear to have been obtained by circumventing the access controls of FFS’s video hosting service. If this is correct, such circumvention also violated DMCA § 1201.","Fast Forward Stories' business has been harmed by respondent's infringement in lost revenue, reduced market and substantially increased risk of additional infringement(s).

Respondent could have availed themselves of the content by licensing directly from FFS — in fact, the CMI information on each video indicate clearly the Internet location where licensing could have been arranged.  By electing to evade protections, copy, upload, display and make the work available for public performance, respondent deprived FFS of the modest fees respondent would have paid to license the content legally.  For the span of time these illegal copies have been publicly available, FFS licensing and hosting fees for respondent would have ranged from $6,534 to $26,344, depending on the set of videos selected.

The public display and ease of free public performance enabled by respondent's illegal posting of the videos on the dominant public video service (YouTube) also harmed FFS by reducing the market for commercial licensing.  Potential licensees have turned down licensing and payment because ""they could get the same thing on YouTube"", depriving FFS of the opportunity to recoup its substantial investments in research, content design and development, and technical development of a video service. For the span of time these illegal copies have been publicly available, licensing fees for lost customers would have ranged from $6,534 to $26,344 EACH, depending on the choice of services.

YouTube is the most widely-used video hosting service in the world; by uploading these illegal videos to YouTube and choosing to make them publicly available, respondent enabled bypass of FFS' careful anti-download measures.  A web search for 'download video from YouTube' will return over 5 million results. These include numerous free online services that require nothing more than copy-and-paste of the URL of the infringing videos to enable further piracy of the content. The impact on lost licensing fees for FFS is difficult to estimate.

Claimant seeks appropriate statutory damages as relief."

Using my work in such a manner devalues it and makes it not as desirable to other potential local clients who may wish to license it properly for it's use. I originally sent them a very reasonable $4500.00 invoice for it's use, which equates to $100.00 a month. This is far below the regular retail license price of my video as seen on my licensing agency Nimia. Just one sequence of my video would license for $1000.00 a year for this type of use. They used the entire video containing 71 unique timelapse sequences. I was notified through email there would be no funds to pay me and that all the parties involved now work and run VistaSuite, another Wheaton, IL based tech company.

22-CCB-0220,Kirbyko Music LLC v. Smuin Ballet,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/1030,"- Smuin Ballet used my work “The Sting of Loss” in their choreographed and performed dance work “Loss” for 5 filmed and streamed performances in February 11-15, 2021.  No synchronization rights were obtained for the synchronization of the music to the film which was used for the live-streaming of the performance on each of the 5 occasions. Smuin did not obtain grand rights licenses for the dramatization of this work, and they did not obtain master recording licenses for the use of the sound recording. Additionally, they did not obtain public performance rights for the performances or the web streaming uses of the filmed work.
- Grand rights are required here as the dance work ""Loss"" used my music ""The Sting of Loss"" to convey a dramatic narrative. Per Smuin Ballet's own description: "" ... we revisit ""LOSS"", Cassidy Isaacson'y emotional solo created for Lauren Pschirrer earlier this year, which she described as a way to express grief when you don't know how to do it in words.... For Lauren, the creative process meant revisiting the experience of loss and feeling those emotions all over again. She recalled that it was uncomfortable at first, but using that emotion and putting it into the movement became very therapeutic.""
- 5 streaming performances were held online with tickets at $30 apiece. A total of $20,000 was made in ticket sales, and there were sponsorships made from donors towards this program which contained multiple works. This dance work “Loss” was directly sponsored by donors David Young and Donald Bird: Smuin would not disclose the amount of their sponsorship of the creation of this work.
- After the filmed work was streamed live 5 times for an admission fee of $30, the filmed work was placed on the Smuin website, and YouTube, Facebook and Instagram in promotion of Smuin Ballet. I did takedowns on each as I discovered them.
- no music cuesheet was created for BMI, which represents my public performance royalties for the 5 streamed performances, as well as for the YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, and smuinballet.org streaming of the filmed work. Public performance royalties are also due here.

1) YouTube: published Aug 30, 2021 - I took it down Aug 30, 2021.
2) Facebook & Instagram: published September 1, 2021.  I took them down 9/22/22

My proposed resolution to Smuin, which they declined:

I quoted settlement fees that involved only the smallest penalties:

Grand rights + master recording rights
- my normal fee is $300 per performance for a company of this size, which is inclusive of grand and master recording rights (basically $150 each for a total of $300). A 10x penalty fee per performance is industry-standard for unlicensed music usage in this context. 
 
Master Recording (label for use of sound recording) + Synchronization (publisher for the use of the composition) rights / audiovisual use
- my normal fee would be a total of $2500 ($1250 master + $1250 sync) for in-perpetuity web streaming rights for that film, including use of that 1 film (1 edit only, no cut-downs or alt versions) for fundraising purposes, such as display at live events or galas, or online fundraisers. A 10x fee is the music publishing industry standard penalty fee for unlicensed use. 
 
My proposal for resolution is not as drastic as the penalties I’ve outlined above. I do want to assess some penalties here but it’s not my intention to burn down your house. 
 
Grand Rights + master recording rights
- $300 is my fee for a live performance; I would’ve quoted the same fee for this use as streaming-only performances.
- my resolution here is a triple fee per performance: that is $900 x 5 performances ($4500). The music may not be used in any performances again unless it is licensed in advance.
 
Video usage dating back to first stream in 2021:
- I would’ve quoted the standard $2500 I noted above as there would’ve been no reason to have quoted higher than my normal rate for the streaming of this video on your social platforms.
- I will do a fee of $2500 here - no penalties attached - to license this film retroactive to the date of creation, and allowing continued use in perpetuity on any web streaming or social media platform that is Smuin-branded, including your dancers’ or choreographers’ personal/professional platforms. There will be a credit requirement in the contract as well.
 
This brings the total resolution for the 5 unlicensed performances and unlicensed 1+ year’s streaming use of the film to $7000.

-----------------------
 
- they rejected this offer and countered with $1200; I came down to a fee of $5500 as a gesture of wanting to settle amicably and they countered with $2000. I rejected this offer. 
- Lori Laqua’s replies indicated that they do normally license their music, and she was versed enough in licensing that she had a range of fees she could say they have normally paid for music use, which indicates that Smuin is aware of its legal obligation to license. Yet they didn’t license my work for this film or its streamed performances. This is direct evidence of willful infringement: Smuin Ballet is fully aware of its legal obligation to license its music and has done so in the past, but chose not to for this work and these performances.   
- At the time I quoted these fees, I did not understand that the work had been filmed, and then the filmed product is what was streamed 5 times. My initial settlement offer did not include synchronization rights for the synchronization of the composition to the filmed work. This would have increased the fee further.
- Additionally, I received no public performance royalties from 1) the 5 live-streamed performances 2) the permanent posts of the film on YouTube, Instagram and Facebook.","1) I did not receive license fees for these commercial uses of my work. 
2) Smuin Ballet used my work to generate income for itself: admission fees, donations, and direct sponsorships from patrons.
3) for a composer, being able to tout and publicize the use of his work by a ballet company is a feather in his cap: it's validation of one's work. Smuin deprived me of the ability to publicize my involvement with this work and with their company, which is a known dance company in the world of contemporary ballet.

The normal penalty for unlicensed music use in the world of music publishing and master recordings is a 3x-10x fee penalty per infringing use. I initially proposed a 3x penalty of my normal fees for live performance/grand rights use and *no penalty multiplier* for the year-long use of the filmed performance on Smuin's website and social media sites. That total fee was $7000. Smuin rejected it saying they normally paid between $50 - $1500 for music use - which only confirmed my suspicion that Smuin is well aware of its legal obligation to license its music, and in this case, chose not to. This is a willful infringement. 

I now seek the following fees inclusive of penalties:

1) grand rights + master recording rights + synchronization rights for creating the filmed performance: ($600 usual fee) 3x penalty = $1800
2) grand rights + master recording rights for use in streaming as live performances w/admission fees: ($300 per performance usual fee) 3x penalty = $900 x 5 perfs = $5600
3) grand rights, synchronization and master recording rights for web streaming use for more than 1 year in a fundraising capacity for Smuin Ballet on their website and web-streaming social media platforms: ($2500 normal fee inclusive of all rights) 3x = $7500
4) public performance (BMI) rights: $50/ per streamed performance =$250; $100 per streamed outlet $400 total = $650 total

Total settlement fee:  $15,500"

22-CCB-0207,Rigdon v. Appleby,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/869,"“Oddheader” is a gaming YouTube channel created by Randall Rigdon Jr. (“Randall”) in 2018, who produces the videos with Cassandra Lipp (“Cassandra”) and a third collaborator who goes by the pseudonym of “Slippy Slides” online. The Oddheader channel, as of this writing, has 770,000 subscribers and has been featured in a number of online entertainment press outlets such as Kotaku and NME for being the first to document and solve exclusive mysteries and discoveries in video games. 

The type of content in each of the original works produced by the Oddheader team involves hundreds of hours of labor spent doing numerous things such as talking to developers for the first time to get exclusive information about mysteries in games, modifying video game code to uncover never-before-seen details, and creatively composing and narrating scripted original works for publication. Every original work features new content from the subject video game that has never been published before Oddheader’s publication of the work, usually as a product of extensive research, composition, scripting, and edited material.

On September 21, 2022, Slippy Slides informed Randall and Cassandra in a private Discord chat that a YouTube channel called “T5G” had uploaded a video called “22 Gaming EASTER EGGS Found YEARS Later.”  The video uploaded by T5G included extensive clips created by Randall and his team for the Oddheader channel.  No credit was given to Oddheader, Randall, or any member of his team for the clips utilized by T5G, suggesting to the public that the video was entirely T5G’s original content. No permission, license, or waiver was offered by Randall, or any member of his team, to T5G, and the use was unauthorized.

On October 2, 2022 Slippy Slides informed Randall and Cassandra of another new video uploaded on T5G’s YouTube channel titled “20 CREEPIEST Secrets in Kid Games.”  Again, the video utilized Oddheader’s original, creative content.  After several viewings of T5G’s video, Randall could find a tiny, momentary flash of a note that purported to give some credit to Oddheader.  

Watching the “20 CREEPIEST Secrets in Kid Games” video brought immediate alarm to Randall and Cassandra. The video concept in itself appeared to be a derivative of Oddheader’s popular video series “Shocking Easter Eggs in Kid Games Analyzed & Ranked” which has millions of views across all of its videos. In T5G’s “20 CREEPIEST Secrets in Kid Games” video, out of the 20 segments T5G shows, Randall and Cassandra were able to count at least 15 of the segments were made of materials originally published first on the Oddheader YouTube channel, making a large majority of the video consist of content previously published on Oddheader.  Randall and Cassandra were able to determine that the 15 T5G video segments in T5G’s video “20 CREEPIEST Secrets in Kid Games” were taken from 8 separate, originally created videos from the Oddheader channel. More detailed information on how this video infringes on the specific Oddheader videos is detailed below. 

In addition, T5G’s video provided no clear indication of where the segment content was found or who created the segment content.  This lack of acknowledgment falsely suggests to the public that T5G, not Oddheader, created the content, performed the original research, crafted and created the findings, and created the work product. Further, elements of actual footage, edits, and graphics taken directly from Oddheader videos could also be seen in T5G’s video for which T5G did not obtain with any authorization, license, or permission from any member of the Oddheader team.

For example, some of the segment footage shown in T5G’s video included creative, graphical edits made by Randall for the Oddheader video which required extensive hours and unique, creative content to construct. These segments were used in T5G’s video without any attribution or credit to, or authorization, license, or permission from, Oddheader. By way of another example, one of the pieces of segment footage shown on T5G’s video was a piece of material that required many extended hours of original research and creativity by Randall and Slippy Slides to produce originally.  The segment was based on information online that was inaccurate and required Slippy Slides and Randall many creative hours to figure out how to produce the result in a way that was properly portrayed on screen. The skills and creativity used to address this particular segment was entirely unique to the Oddheader team and likely could not be reproduced by others like T5G.  T5G had clear and easy access to the original work belonging to the Oddheader channel and without authorization, license, or permission, T5G took the work and used it as its own for commercial gain.

In addition to the segment material first published and produced on the Oddheader channel, Oddheader also had unique and scripted creative narration or a written transcript that accompanied the segments.  T5G reused Oddheader’s transcript without authorization, license, or permission in the T5G video posted on YouTube.  In the T5G video, the narrator essentially restates the same transcript used in the Oddheader videos. The T5G video doesn’t make any additional observations or comments that were not already stated the same way in the Oddheader video – no effort was made by T5G to comment on the Oddheader video or produce a video that was distinguished or transformative in any material way. 

The obvious use of Oddheader video as a singular source for the T5G video is clear because the T5G video makes the same assumptions as the Oddheader video, draws the same conclusions as the Oddheader video, and in certain instances some of the same comedic punchlines as even taken from the Oddheader video. Since the T5G video fails and refuses to acknowledge any of the original creative and unique research and labor of Oddheader required to produce the Oddheader material, T5G gives the viewer the impression that T5G is the original author and creator who researched and produced the material when in fact, it was Oddheader that spent many extended hours to produce and create. This infringement and misrepresentation causes Oddheader to suffer potential damage to the Oddheader brand because it confuses the audience and the marketplace, degrades the Oddheader brand, and calls into question to credit owed to Oddheader for its unique and creative work product.

The offending T5G video contains minor motion edits to the footage and other typical tricks that are used frequently on YouTube to avoid automatic copyright detection. However, these minor edits are not enough to constitute an original work or to transform Oddheader’s work and the use of the commonly used tactic demonstrates a clear intent to infringe upon Oddheader copyrights.

Upon learning of this infringement, Randall filed a take-down request with YouTube’s copyright department.  In response, Thomas Appleby (“Appleby”) of T5G filed a counterclaim admitting that he used 3 seconds from Oddheader’s video but arguing that he had transformed the material with the purpose of posting a teaching and educational video. Neither of these arguments are accurate.  Appleby's video clearly utilizes infringing material lasting more than 3 seconds of segment footage.  Also, Appleby is not using the video for any kind of non-commercial purpose such as teaching, educating, or otherwise.  Finally, Appleby’s use of Oddheader’s segment footage and transcript use is not in any way transformative.  Instead, the segments in T5G’s video does not differ in any meaningful way from the original works from Oddheader that made up the bulk of T5G’s video.

Use of the Oddheader videos and transcripts without authorization constitutes infringement under §106 of the Copyright Act. The counter notice by T5G and Thomas Appleby fails to assert that use by T5G is a fair use, as the use is commercial, uses a substantial portion of the original work, uses it for the same purpose as the original, and is not transformative. By distribution through the same trade channels, it will inevitably have a material effect on the market for Oddheader’s original works. 

Below is a more detailed breakdown of the infringement of Oddheader original videos by T5G/Appleby to identify the source from which specific segment footage and/or transcript content was used in the T5G video:

(For example, T5G’s infringing video uses the following transcript text: “If you entered free camera mode and looked at the side of the box, you could look at the side of one of the boxes in the factory and see a message.” This was an exclusive piece of information contained in the Oddheader transcript that was first published in the Oddheader video using original, creative research by Randall. It was not previously known to the public that the message could be seen in the game by using a free camera until Randall successfully researched and manipulated the game to use this free camera and revealed this aspect of the game.)

This is original video footage being used here without authorization, first published in the Oddheader video “10 Most Shocking Easter Eggs & Discoveries in Kids Games - Part III,” timestamped here (https://youtu.be/uzOl1TP62Nc?t=643). The infringing video uses original, creative research and footage that Randall owns, even including the original censorship edits that Randall made, which took a painstaking amount of time to produce using animation tools. Randall is the exclusive owner of this footage and paid Slippy Slides for labor spent working on and playing the game to create this footage. Even the frame around the footage was custom made by Randall using multiple layers, cropping, and stretching, as it was impossible to simply stretch the footage to get it in full screen without it looking abnormal. The entire segment was also only possible with original, creative research done by the Oddheader team about the underlying work, as the information about it online was incorrect and the labor paid for and owned by Randall, as well as the research done by himself, resulted in figuring out how to get the result featured in the footage to work properly. The Oddheader video was the first published source for this correct information. Oddheader owns the underlying footage and there was no permission sought at all by T5G/Appleby.

Timestamp in infringing video: 7:32-7:57 
Original copyrighted work timestamp video link: https://youtu.be/sWBkT3xLfso?t=261 
•	Psychonauts (7:32-7:57 of T5G’s infringing video). This discovery was first published on the Oddheader channel in the video “8 Unexpectedly Dark Secrets in Video Games,” timestamped here (https://youtu.be/sWBkT3xLfso?t=261).","Appleby’s video “20 CREEPIEST Secrets in Kid Games,” uploaded on his T5G YouTube channel was a clear copying of the popular YouTube video series “Shocking Easter Eggs In Kids Games” from the YouTube channel Oddheader and used original work from 8 different videos produced for and by the Oddheader channel.  At no time was Appleby/T5G given any authorization, license, or permission from Oddheader for use of any Oddheader content which comprised the majority of T5G’s video without any attribution to the infringed work. Doing so caused numerous damages to Oddheader and to the Oddheader brand. 

Appleby’s unauthorized use of the materials produced by the Oddheader channel was designed to intentionally misled his audience into thinking the original material was his own and to confuse the marketplace. It was an attempt to move traffic away from the Oddheader channel and to his own channel, T5G, using unauthorized, original, creative material originally produced by and for the Oddheader channel. 

Appleby’s unauthorized use passes off hundreds of hours of labor and creative research from the Oddheader channel as his own for commercial monetary gains. Appleby’s video garnered a million views before Randall of Oddheader claimed the video, which accounts for a million views that were taken away from the Oddheader channel. 

Appleby’s unauthorized use of the work purposely confuses the audience about who actually produced the original work and who was the first to publish it, directly hurting the Oddheader brand, which is known for being the first to publish the material and the kind of material that was infringed. 

The unauthorized use prevents future potential viewers from seeing the original infringed work belonging to Oddheader as they can feel they’ve already seen the material on T5G and therefore decide not to watch the original infringed work, not knowing that Oddheader was the original source. The infringement also confuses the marketplace as viewers may believe the T5G video to be a video produced by Oddheader, as well as hurts the viewer's ability to find the original work produced by Oddheader. The thumbnail itself uses an image that can only be originally sourced from the Oddheader Twitter account and uses a similar title and packaging as the Oddheader original work in an attempt to mislead the audience into believing the T5G infringing video was an original work when in fact, it is original Oddheader work.

Appleby’s infringement and refusal to keep the video down caused further harm to Oddheader and the Oddheader production schedule, accruing more potential losses for the Oddheader team. 

Appleby’s infringement was done to confuse viewers into believing the material infringed was his own to channel monetary opportunities away from the Oddheader channel and towards his own channel. The passing off of original work belonging to Oddheader as his own also hurts the credibility of the Oddheader brand, which is known for being the first to publish such materials and Appleby’s video gave no indication that he did not originally publish the infringed materials nor does the video credit Oddheader as being the original publisher. 

Because Appleby took footage directly from original works produced for the Oddheader channel without authorization, he obtained these materials illegally and also took away a licensing opportunity for Oddheader, for which a licensing fee would be required for each use of the materials that Appleby infringed.

The relief the Oddheader team is seeking is for the infringing work to no longer be distributed nor be allowed to be publicly and/or commercially available, as well as an agreement from Appleby to no longer infringe on or use original works from the Oddheader channel without proper authorization, license, or permission from Oddheader. Oddheader is also seeking an additional remedy for the actual damages that were incurred by Oddheader as a result of the infringement, including compensation for its attorneys’ fees and costs."

22-CCB-0204,Wong v. 刘,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/804,"The infringement activity was occurred when the Respondent and the Infringer, who I neither know or meet him at anywhere nor any relationship with him, uploaded an infringing video to URL at issue: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu5g7gxDC64 on August 18, 2022 with a video title name in Chinese wordings “水果是糖尿病人的禁忌？大錯特錯！醫生提醒這5種可以放心吃，血糖絕對不會升高！趕緊轉發告訴家裏人 |三味書屋”. The infringement activity committed by the Respondent and the Infringer was occurred without my awareness, permission and consent at the beginning. I was only able to discover the infringement activity in the early of October 2022 when I watched the video at issue online. What I had discovered from the infringing video at issue http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu5g7gxDC64 was that the Respondent and the Infringer substantially plagiarize my copyright work with exact character-by-character and sequence-by-squence, and replicated them into the infringing video’s playback timestamp between 1:58 minutes until 11:29 minutes without seeking my permission and consent by any means. As the author and the Claimant of the copyright work, I had responded to the infringement activity by submitting a copyright claim request to the online content service provider YouTube on October 3, 2022 asking for the Respondent to remove the infringing video immediately. On October 6, 2022, as per requested in YouTube’s email reply, I had further described the infringement activity in break-down details to prove and convince the online content service provider of the wrongful activity ran by the Respondent and the Infringer. Below are the infringement activity break-down details that I had described to the content service provider in Chinese wordings: [說明1] 他的侵犯視頻從01:50分鐘開始 ”想知道什麼水果對糖尿病最好最健康嗎？"" 至01:54分鐘，是抄襲我的原創視頻中的00:34秒至00:38秒 ”想知道什麼水果對糖尿病最好最健康嗎？""（相似度：100%）[說明2] 他的侵犯視頻從01:58分鐘開始 “我們都知道吃水果對身體有益...."" 至02:17分鐘，是抄襲我的原創視頻中的00:56至01:13分鐘 ”你一定知道吃水果對身體有益....""（相似度：98%）[說明3] 他的侵犯視頻從02:18分鐘開始 “第一 蘋果...."" 至03:39分鐘，是抄襲我的原創視頻中的01:16至02:23分鐘 ""第一 蘋果....”（相似度：100%）[說明4] 他的侵犯視頻從03:40分鐘開始 “第二 牛油果...."" 至05:54分鐘，是抄襲我的原創視頻中的02:24至4:12分鐘 ”第二 牛油果....""（相似度：100%）[說明5] 他的侵犯視頻從05:55分鐘開始 “第三 番石榴....” 至07:43分鐘，是抄襲我的原創視頻中的04:29至06:01分鐘 “第三 番石榴....""（相似度：100%） [說明6] 他的侵犯視頻從07:44分鐘開始 ""第四 藍莓....” 至09:24分鐘，是抄襲我的原創視頻中的06:02至07:24分鐘 ""第四 藍莓....""（相似度：100%） [說明7] 他的侵犯視頻從09:25分鐘開始 “第五 沙梨....""至11:19分鐘，是抄襲我的原創視頻中的07:25至09:00分鐘 ""第五 沙梨....""（相似度：100%） [說明8] 他的侵犯視頻從11:19分鐘開始 “以上就是....""至11:29分鐘，是抄襲我的原創視頻中的09:01至09:20分鐘 ""以上就是....""（相似度：98%).

(Similarity: 98%). By looking at the overall perspective of the infringing video length of 12:15 minutes or 735 seconds, the Respondent and the Infringer had took and replicated my copyright work up to 77.68% or equivalent to 571 seconds, with the similarity of 100%. It was obviously a substantial wrongful activity committed by the Respondent and the Infringer.  With all these evidences and details that I had provided to the online content service provider, YouTube, after thorough investigation and review, convinced by the wrongful activity committed by the Respondent, and the infringing video URL at issue http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu5g7gxDC64 had been took down from the Respondent’s channel on October 10, 2022. Nevertheless, the Respondent who committed the wrongful activity had submitted a counter notification to the online content service provider in response to my copyright removal request, asking for the infringing video to be reinstated to his YouTube channel.","The Respondent’s wrongful activity has caused suffers to the Claimant in term of: 1) My channel brand name is being tainted when the Respondent unilaterally stressed that the infringing video uploaded by him would benefit my channel from his wrongful activity in term of subscriber, view, market exposure share and profit, as per mentioned in his counter notification statement, 2) My personal credibility is being tainted when the Respondent claimed that I mistakenly reported him for the infringement, while in fact, the Respondent admitted his own wrongful activity in his counter notification to YouTube,  3) Loss of work productivity due to time and energy consumed in tackling the infringement, 4) Body harm due to a week long of sleep-less nights to deal with the infringement,  5) Mind and brain stress caused by the infringement disturbance, 6) Loss of appetite and minor gastrointestinal problem caused by the infringement disturbance.       

For all these reasons and harms suffered to me, as the author and the Claimant, I decided to file this infringement claim to the US Copyright Claim Board to seek for: 1) Restrain the allegedly infringement from being reinstated on YouTube, 2) Restrain the allegedly infringement from showing in any other online content service platforms, websites, social media, television, or any offline platforms such as printed articles, magazines, books, posters, press releases and etc, 3) Written agreement by the Respondent to express his regret of the wrongful activity and his promise to stop any kind of similar attempt in the future, 4) Any profits that the Respondent had made through the allegedly infringement,
5) Monetary relief that deems necessary and reasonable based on CCB’s justification and final determination."
22-CCB-0201,"Checkit TV v. An All American Cartel LLC, et al",https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/781,"On information and belief, Respondents posted an audio visual work that contained in its entirety the Claimant's subject work.  Additionally, Claimant's work was reproduced by Respondents in the same form as that published by Claimant.  Therefore, the Claimant's work appears to have been directly copied and included within Respondent's work.  The infringed material can be found, on information and belief, beginning at the six minute and 30 second mark of the Respondent's video and concluding at the sixteenth minute and 30 second mark.  The Respondent's infringing work has been taken down by YouTube and can no longer be viewed at this time based on notice given by Claimant of its infringing nature and Claimant's rights in copyright.  However, save for this Claim, the Respondent's work is likely to be re-posted as early as the 14th of September, 2022.  The Claimant's video and thus the infringed work can be found on YouTube at the following URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjYNfrb5NJs. Claimant broadly disclosed notice of copyright with the work.  Additionally, Claimant filed for copyright registration within a day of publication.","Claimant is and has been establishing an ever-growing YouTube channel which reports on and investigates matters of public interest.  The current subscriber base is over 16,000 members and the posted videos receive generally thousands to tens of thousands of views with many comments by interested viewers.  The Claimant, through this channel, is furthering a market for a certain type of in-depth, detailed, and personal news gathering and distribution of newsworthy events that are not typically known through typical news outlets.  Respondent competes in a similar type of market and through infringement of Claimant's works has furthered Respondent's YouTube video channel at the diminished and expense of Claimant's YouTube video channel.  Claimant receives revenues from its channel generally through the number of subscribers, views and through paid membership.  Respondent, on information and belief, similarly, receives revenues generally based on the number of subscribers and views.  As a result, Claimant submits that Claimant has lost revenues through the infringement of Claimant's work while Respondent has profited from it.  Thus, these are commercial enterprises.  Claimant seeks damages based on the amount of Claimant's lost profits; Respondent's unjust enrichment or profits received as a result of the infringement; and statutory damages, to the maximum amount permitted under this .  In addition, Claimant seeks an injunction restraining Respondent from posting the infringing work once again on YouTube or in any public or non-public forum. Claimant further seeks attorney's fees and costs."

22-CCB-0177,Okoruwa v. Saxenmeyer,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/675,"Your Honor,

Thank you so much for the opportunity to present this matter before the CCB. Please find below a  brief background of the issue:

In March of 2015, I hired Mark Saxenmeyer of The Reporters Inc. a Minneapolis-based media production agency to assist with fundraising and perform certain production work for completion of my documentary film series titled: The Innocent Convicts. A fundraising contract and Project Assistance Area Agreement(see attached please) were drafted by The Reporters Inc. Executive Director, Mark Saxenmeyer which expressly provides ownership of all videos created for The Innocent Convicts project belong to me and my studio-Mankind Pictures. I paid the sum of $250 out of $500 which was due as project initiation fee as stated in that agreement. Although I initially titled the Project Tim Cole, The Innocent Man, I renamed it The Innocent Convicts in 2015 due to the need to include more stories to the Film project.

I started with filming the  story of Tim Cole in Texas and three years later, we had completed production of six stories that happened in five different cities with a timeline of completion set for 2016/17. The project was not completed as promised and l later found out Mark Saxenmeyer was claiming ownership of The Innocent Convicts film, the name, my artistic creation, the video footage, contents and materials associated with my documentary film.","I have made multiple request for the raw and completed copies of the videos in the possession of Mark Saxenmeyer and The Reporters Inc., and they have refused to provide the videos to me. I also requested a detailed breakdown of funds raised as well as Expenditure report and all materials related to the film. Mark Saxenmeyer has seized the raw and final work product of The Innocent Convicts film unlawfully and has refused to provide accounting for the money raise for this project which is a breach of our agreement. 

Mark Saxenmeyer has continued to distribute The Innocent Convicts film online and at educational institutions without my permission, and has continued to profit from my work without my consent. See attached letters on behalf of the Reporters Inc. to me and vice versa please. Also attached are the Agenda and Minutes of the Reporters Inc. Board Meeting in 2016, and Email indicating title name change..

Only towards the third quarter of last year we heard from Mark's lawyer after l contacted another attorney based in Minneapolis to reach out to him. On the Reporters Inc. website, they removed my film about Tim Cole and renamed my other 5 films ""Guilty Until Proven Innocent."" These film is relevant now because of the renewed calls for police reforms but Mark Saxenmeyer has disappeared with my work products. This experience has devastated me, caused financial difficulty for me and my family as I really on my artistic creation to make ends meet, and coupled with the pandemic, I have suffered irreparable harm."

22-CCB-0158,Reeder v. Acuity Network Services,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/591,Acuity Network Services was using an unauthorized reproduction of the Cisco TelePresence Webex Meeting Photograph to advertise its own competing products and services on its own website.,"In 2013, I was engaged by Cisco Systems, Inc. (“Cisco”) to do an extensive photo shoot in Oslo for Cisco’s marketing materials. Total billing for production, fees, etc. for that shoot was over $100,000, which included the hiring of several models. As part of that project, I set up and created a photo for Cisco’s Webex Meeting suite of products. Cisco received a lifetime license to use the Webex Meeting Photograph, which Cisco has indeed used in connection with
marketing its products. Photograph is protected by U.S. Copyright Registration No. VAu 1-138-361. (Cisco web use: https://www.cisco.com/c/en_in/products/conferencing/webex-meeting-center/index.html)

Acuity’s use of the Cisco Webex Meeting Photograph illegally took the economic value that Cisco invested, and my future potential re-licensing and used the photo in direct competition with Cisco’s products, in violation of U.S. and state laws of unfair competition and false advertising.

Moreover, Acuity’s unauthorized use of the Cisco Webex Meeting Photograph violates the rights of publicity of the models shown in Acuity’s infringing image, who did not give Acuity any rights to commercially reproduce their likenesses. Those models’ rights are protected under California and international laws of publicity rights.

I demand that Acuity remove all copies of the Cisco Webex Meeting Photograph from all of its materials, including all internal archives or digital files, and further, that Acuity pay a settlement fee for Acuity’s unauthorized copyright infringement in the amount of $15,000.

My attorney (at great expense to myself) has sent multiple settlement demand letters on my behalf, starting in June. Acuity has not replied in any way. They have removed the photo from their website.

They have been told merely removing the infringing copy of the photograph from Acuity’s site will not absolve Acuity of liability.

Infringements such as these have greatly diminished the ability for professional photographers to continue to stay in business. When people go online and believe they can steal images at no cost with no repercussions, they will continue to do it."

Claimant is the creator and copyright owner of the photograph 250A9084.jpg. The photograph was first published on July 22nd, 2018. Claimant registered the photograph with the USCO under Registration Certificate VA 2-123-376 with an effective date of registration of September 19th, 2018.

Respondent is a home remodeling firm located in Fort Worth, TX. Respondent owns and operates the website www.luxuryhomeremodelingdfw.com and Facebook page www.facebook.com/luxuryhomeremodelingdfw which it uses to promote its business.

On or about December 20th, 2021, Claimant discovered his photograph being used on the Respondent’s website claiming it represents a home remodel project that the Respondent completed in Frisco, TX. Claimant did not grant permission for Respondent to copy, display or distribute his photograph on Respondent’s website or Facebook page to promote Respondent’s business.

Claimant retained the law firm SRIP Law to attempt to negotiate a settlement with the Respondent. SRIP Law emailed a demand letter to the Respondent on February 16th, 2022.  The demand letter included a notice to the Respondent to cease and desist all unauthorized uses of Claimant’s work.

22-CCB-0148,Mikhail Glabets Photography LCC v. Island entertainment dba Spring House Hotel,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/449,"I’m here to collect $5000 from Island Entertainment and Spring House Hotel. The business took a photograph of mine and used it in 2 magazine print advertisements over the course of the year. They did not have permission or the rights to that photo. I learned when confronting them over this issue that they were about to take out a third advertisement. Each advertisement cost $5,000. They spent money to advertise the business, but did not properly pay for the art used in that advertisement. 

I sent the owner Frank an invoice to collect the fees for the use of that photo in a commercial advertisement. He repeatedly refused my invoices and tried to intimidate and shame me for the simple practice of collecting payment for my work and time. When I called again to pursue the invoice after 6+months of it going ignored, he paid lawyers to send me a cease and desist order to prevent me from communicating with his business and pursuing payment.

He claims he understood he had the rights to use this photo. He did not. I have in writing that I gave his marketing manager permission to share a photo of mine in social media, with an explicit credit to my account. No other use case. This permission was in no way granted for them to take out print ads, which bring profit to their business and absolutely nothing to mine. 

The $5,000 sought represented fees for licensing my work for paid marketing, as well as the cost of my time in pursuing this unnecessarily long process. Frank should have paid a simple invoice for a product he used in his business: my photography.","I would receive multiple inquries a year and opportunites to photograph weddings at the spring house hotel which i can no longer take because of this issue and the 'cease and decease' their lawyers sent me, also in good faith- they stole from me. I lost 4500$ worth of business billing hours as a result of pursuing this claim including all the information gathering and communications with the defendants lawyers."
22-CCB-0146,"Joe Hand Promotions, Inc. v. Tango Bravo Charlie, Inc., et al",https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/444,"Claimant Joe Hand Promotions, Inc. (""Claimant"") is a Pennsylvania corporation that specializes in commercially licensing premier sporting events to commercial locations such as bars, restaurants, lounges, clubhouses and similar establishments. 

By written agreement, Claimant was granted the exclusive right to license, display, and distribute publicly [17 U.S.C. § 106(4) & (5)] the Ultimate Fighting Championship® 242: Khabib Nurmagomedov vs. Dustin Poirier mixed martial arts program, including all undercard bouts and commentary, on September 7, 2019 (the ""Program"") for businesses such as the business made the basis of this claim.  Commercial businesses such as the business made the basis of this suit were not authorized to receive and exhibit the Program in their commercial business without authorization from Claimant.

Respondents Tango Bravo Charlie, Inc. and Thomas Halverson (collectively the ""Respondents"") owned, operated, maintained, and controlled the commercial business known as Shooters Bar & Grille located at 6 N. Maple, Watertown, SD 57201 (the “Establishment”) on the date of the Program.

Respondent Thomas Halverson is an individual who resides in the State of South Dakota and was a member, manager, officer and/or principal of the entity owning and operating the Establishment on the date of the Program.  Respondent Thomas Halverson had a right and ability to supervise the activities of the Establishment on the date of the Program and had an obvious and direct financial interest in the activities of the Establishment on the date of the Program.

Prior to the broadcast of the Program, Respondents could have contracted with Claimant and purchased authorization to exhibit the Program in the Establishment for a fee.  However, Respondents chose not to contract with Claimant or pay the fee to Claimant to obtain the proper license or authorization. At no time did Claimant give Respondents license, permission or authority to receive and exhibit the Program in the Establishment.

Instead, Respondents, including their agents, servants, and/or employees, took affirmative steps to circumvent the commercial licensing requirement and unlawfully obtained the Program and exhibited it in their Establishment. 
 
Upon information and belief, Respondents willfully engaged in illegal acts to receive the Program for free or at nominal cost while Claimant’s legitimate customers paid several thousand dollars.  Respondents knew, or should have known, their receipt and exhibition of the Program at their establishment was not authorized.

Upon information and belief, Respondents intentionally pirated the Program for the sole purpose of their own economic gain. Respondents exhibited the Program for the commercial purpose of attracting paying customers, patrons, members, and guests, thereby wrongfully benefiting financially by infringing Claimant’s rights in the Program.

Respondents did not have license, authorization, permission, or consent from Claimant to exhibit the Program in the Establishment.

As exclusive licensee of the Program, Claimant has standing and capacity to bring this action in its own name against Respondents for their violation of the Copyright Act.

Respondents’ unauthorized display and public performance of the Program through any means was in violation of 17 U.S.C. §§ 106 and 501.

Respondents’ acts of infringement were not only willful, intentional, and purposeful, but also in complete disregard of and indifference to Claimant’s rights.

Accordingly, Claimant is entitled to judgment in its favor and against each Respondent, jointly and severally, for statutory damages, in the discretion of the Board, plus interest, costs and attorneys’ fees.","Claimant seeks statutory damages in the discretion of the Board, of up to the maximum amount of $15,000.00 for the Respondents’ willful violation of 17 U.S.C. § 501 and for Claimant’s attorney’s fees, interest, and costs of proceedings."

Melissa Mulhollan has a private TiKTOK acount with 10 videos playing videos of me holding up the  book that at the time was being published by PrinciplesLLC. Since July 1, 2022 ZeeT Publishing obtained exclusive publication rights for the said book. Melissa Mulhollan was notified in writing about the change in publisher and notified and requested multiple times to remove 10 TikToK videos advertising the book and Dr. Dippold as being published by her company Pfrinciples LLC. To date she has blocked Dr. Dippold  from the account so she can not see that they are still up and being advertised. This in itself is 10 accounts of copyright infringement. This is deliberate wrongful acts on her part.
MelissaMulhollan.com
On her personal website she has a section called Just Another Slice ( Again she was notified that she is NOT allowed to advertise or market the book in any manner.) She has a picture of the book and an entire message defaming Dr. Dippold on her personal site claiming she is co-author. 
Melissa Thompsom Mulhollan Facebook
She has a picture of the book on this site telling people not to buy the version under ZeeT Publishing.  Again defaming Dr. Dippold. We have pictures of conversations where she is telling people who want to buy the book with the old cover on it to message her (This version of the book, the cover is the only thing different still is copyrighted by Dr. Dippold) this copy does not exsist anymore so Melissa Mulhollan has to be illegally publishing copies of that book.

Melissa Mulhollan has three facebook post going asking people not to by the book from Amazon that list ZeeT Publishing as the publisher.  We have a copy of a conversation where one person stated that she was going to by the book but Melissa Mulhollan told them not to. We have pictures of Melissa Mulhollan engaging in 41 conversations misrepresenting herself and not clarifying for people that she is not the copyright holder. Plus she is encouraging people to share the post.  This is deliberate and wrongful behavior. One of her friends made a false review on Amazon with a 1 star rating stating that the book was fraudelent published by Zeet and the ""editor is the author too."" This lowered the ranking on Amazon impacting the sales. All of Melissa's infringements are not by accident and are on purpose wrongful doing. If there are any attorney fee's I am requesting the CCB board to consider her being responsible for those fees. 
Due to the defaming comments, her public claims calling me an abuser (I have a picture of the post), her claims I stole the book ( I have a picture of the post) it is not only affecting my author credibility but I am a psychologist with a private practice in the area and she is damaging that as well.  More recent due to her harassing, bullying, slanderous, defaming and infringement behavior, I sought out counseling services as her abuse has triggered some PTSD symptoms. Please keep in mind she helped me in the role of editor in writing my story which is about physical, sexual and emotional abuse in foster. During our time of working together on the book, Melissa who is a published author, convinced me she was a co-author when I gave her the original manuscript to edit. Then she convinced me we were both authors of this story. It not till I began working with a professional editor and spoke with a IP lawyer that I learned I was being exploited by her and that her correct title was editor. Prior to publication I notified Melissa Mulhollan (I have a copy of the email I will upload for proof) that I would not publish the book till her title was corrected though I would keep her on the cover, and we recognized that I am the author as I started writing this story 20 years and she helped me finish it with editing, and the copyright would be in my name only. She agreed and it is in writing and even verified by the professional editor. Also I have a life right agreement in place that  I do not give Melissa Mulhollan permission to write my story and so does my brother Carl Coddington who stated that Melissa Mulhollan does not have his permission to Author or hold any ownership of his story.  Melissa Mulhollan was made aware of this. After publication she began making claims. This copyright is previous registered to 2016 with the first part of the story 3 years before meeting Melissa Mulhollan. I have emails to prove that Melissa Mulhollan was in agreement with my copyright holder status and ""100 owner of the intellectual property"" of Just Another Slice."

Originating website makes income based on advertising. Advertising revenue is dependent on active traffic. The active traffic is reduced when original imagery is duplicated, as SEO engines calculate this into originality of content and results in lower traffic direction to the original single-source posting. ; 2) Direct licensing fee loss.

The author gave permission for a one-time printing of the text as part of a catalog, printed in paper, in the past, in the form a book, in 2015, but never granted unbounded permission of use of the text after that under any other form, and never for online publication, and even less gave the author the text for Tigran T. to copyright it.
On his website the text bears at the end a note indicating that T.T. holds its copyright, which is utterly false. He has been taking advantage of the Plaintiff's work for his own improper enrichment.
This infringement has been committed by him willfully, misleads the public, and it is a gross falsehood. See attached Exhibits proving the fact.","The harm is financial, since the Defendant takes unbounded advantage of the Plaintiff's copyrighted work without proper permission. The harm is also public defamation, in the clear view that the Defendant, not happy enough by using the text online without permision to do so, has been exhibiting, since 2016, the next inscription next to it ""Copyrighted Tigran Tsitoghdzyan"", which is utterly false.

22-CCB-0112,Paramount Pictures Corporation v. JMC POP UPS LLC,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/369,"Copyright Rights: 
 
Paramount Pictures Corporation (“Paramount Pictures”) is the sole and exclusive owner of all right, title, and interest in and to the copyrights in the motion pictures entitled Coming to America and Coming 2 America (hereinafter collectively referred to as the “Works”). The Works are original works of authorship, embodying copyrightable subject matter and subject to the full protection of the copyright laws of the United States.  Paramount Pictures has complied with all requirements and formalities of the Copyright Act with respect to the Works.
 
Paramount Pictures has obtained copyright registration certificates from the United States Copyright Office for each of the Works. Documents showing the registration of a representative sample of the Works are attached collectively as Exhibit 1 (See, e.g., U.S. Copyright Registration Numbers PA0000376420; PA0002280086).
 
Background of the Works:
 
Coming to America was a huge commercial success and the second highest-grossing movie of 1988, and remains immensely popular despite premiering over 30 years ago. See Exhibit 2 https://www.boxofficemojo.com/year/1988/.  Coming to America is an American romantic comedy film. Eddie Murphy stars in the lead role alongside his co-stars Arsenio Hall, James Earl Jones, Shari Headley, and John Amos. The film was released in the United States on June 29, 1988. Eddie Murphy plays Akeem Joffer, the crown prince of the fictional African nation of Zamunda, who travels to the United States in the hopes of finding a woman he can marry and love for who she is, not for her status or for having been trained to please him.
 
Akeem and his best friend/personal aide, Semmi, travel to the New York City borough of Queens and rent a squalid tenement in the neighborhood of Long Island City under the guise of poor foreign students. Beginning their search for Akeem's bride, they end up being invited by some locals to a rally raising money for the inner city. During the rally, Akeem encounters Lisa McDowell, who possesses all the qualities he is looking for. So, upon his insistence, he and Semmi get entry-level jobs working at the local fast-food restaurant called McDowell's, owned by widower Cleo McDowell, Lisa's father
 
The sequel, Coming 2 America, was released on March 4, 2021, on Amazon Prime and was the No. 1 streaming movie during its opening weekend – and had the best opening weekend of any streaming movie in the previous 12 months. See Exhibit 3 https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/amazon-claims-victory-coming-2-213320921.html and https://deadline.com/2021/03/coming-2-america-amazon-first-weekend-viewership-record-1234709342/. The Works’ characters, dialogue, imagery, and other protective elements have attained iconic status and remain fixtures in popular culture. Please find attached examples of the Works as Exhibit 4 and a side-by-side comparison of the Works and the infringing content as Exhibit 5.
 
 

Facts:
 
On or around February 2021, JMC Pop Ups LLC (“JMC”) announced its “McDowell’s” pop-up restaurant (“Infringing Restaurant”), which was intended to be a recreation of the McDowell’s restaurant from the Works. See Exhibit 6-7. The Infringing Restaurant was scheduled for April 16-25, 2021, in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. Id. 
 
On or around March 2021, Paramount Pictures became aware that JMC was promoting and selling tickets for this Infringing Restaurant. See Exhibit 7-8. On March 29, 2022, Paramount Pictures contacted JMC to demand that it cease all its infringing activities in connection with the Infringing Restaurant. See Exhibit 9. 
 
In creating and marketing the Infringing Restaurant, JMC copied countless copyrighted materials from the works, including but not limited to the menu, the character names and likenesses, and the recreations of well-known McDowell’s restaurant from the Coming to America universe.

Specifically, the Infringing Restaurant’s menu used numerous well-known indicia of the Works, including the “Big Mick” with a “non-seed bun” (the “Big Mick” featured in Coming to America); the “Meatless Mick” (a play on the “Beyond Big McBurger” featured in Coming 2 America); the “Louie Anderson” (an actor in the Works); and the “Sexual Chocolate Cake Shake” (the name of the band from the Works). See https://mcdowellspopup.com/menu and Exhibit 5, 7 and 10-12. Further, the event had an “Employee of the Month” photo opportunity for guests, which was an award presented to Akeem in Coming to America.  See Exhibit 7 and 13.

In addition, JMC offered merchandise bearing protected elements from the Works, including but not limited to clothing, stickers, patches, frisbees, pens, and glass cups.  Exhibit 5, 11-12 and 14. In fact, the Chief Executive Officer of JMC was quoted saying, “[i]t’s a tribute to the movie,” and “[y]ou’re going to see similar food items that are in the movie, logos, photo ops that are taken directly from the movie that were reconstructed.”         
See https://www.audacy.com/kywnewsradio/news/local/coming-2-america-inspires-a-cherry-hill-pop-up  and Exhibit 7 and 15.
 
On April 2, 2021, JMC responded that they were within its rights to proceed using the referenced content without the permission of a third party. See Exhibit 16.
 
On April 9, 2021, JMC’s counsel informed Paramount Pictures that their “client is seeking to accommodate [Paramount Pictures] requests and has some items to review on that point.” See Exhibit 17.
 
On April 12, 2021, the parties had a call to discuss JMC’s proposed changes.  
 
On April 14, 2021, Paramount Pictures responded that the changes would not solve the problem and that there was no real way for JMC to continue with the event. Id.
 
On or around April 16-25, 2021, JMC went forward with the Infringing Restaurant and likewise promoted and sold merchandise in violation of Paramount Pictures copyright rights. See Exhibits 5, 11-12, and 14.
 
On February 13, 2022, JMC created a Facebook post stating, “McDowell's is Coming 2 Northern Virginia! Grab a Big Mick, take some photos, relive the memories, and be inside McDowell’s.” See Exhibit 6. The event was scheduled for May 20, 2022, through June 5, 2022. Id.
 
On February 13, 2022, JMC created a Facebook post stating, “Coming 2 the DC area in May!” with a description that stated, “This May eat like the King of Zamunda with a meal from McDowell’s!” Id.
 
On March 13, 2022, JMC created a Facebook post stating, “McDowell's is Coming to the DMV! Home of the Big Mick! Walk into a re-creation of McDowell's, Grab a Big Mick, and enjoy the photo ops and times with friends and family.” Id.
 
On March 29, 2022, the Washingtonian quoted JMC stating, “‘Our experiences are a little different,’ McCullough says of his niche in the pop-cultural pop-up world. While many other pop-ups are centered around a selfie wall or branded drinks, McCullough is obsessed with creating immersive scenes of lifelike accuracy. ‘We try to make it like you’re really there,’ he says.” See https://www.washingtonian.com/2022/03/29/mcdowells-pop-up-coming-to-america-springfield-virginia/ and Exhibit 18. The Washingtonian also stated, JMC’s “McDowell’s will be a multi-room installation that includes not simply the restaurant’s order counter (which serves actual Big Micks), but also re-creations of the dingy apartment where Prince Akeem lives, and Mr. McDowell’s office (guests can sit at his desk, don his blue blazer, and pick up the cheeseburger phone).” Id.

On April 1, 2022, JMC posted an article titled “A ‘Coming to America’ Pop-Up Is Coming to Virginia,” located at https://dc.eater.com/2022/3/30/23003489/virginia-mcdowells-coming-to-america-pop-up-popup-springfield-town-center.  See Exhibit 19. The article stated, “McDowell’s, the burger counter at the heart of Eddie Murphy’s 1988 cult classic romantic comedy Coming to America, is being resurrected this May in Springfield Town Center (6500 Franconia-Springfield Parkway),” and “[t]he seedless bun burger the fictional restaurant is known for is on the menu, plus a meatless variety and a Magnum Mick with one pound of beef on a long, seedless bun. The pop-up will also sling chicken chunks, salads, and a few more items.” Id.  Additionally, it stated, “in addition to the burger cafe at the heart of the movie, the pop-up will also bring to life Murphy’s character’s apartment and Mr. McDowell’s office, also according to the Washingtonian.” Id.
 
On or around April 2022, Paramount Pictures became aware that JMC was promoting and selling tickets to another infringing event entitled “McDowell’s” in Springfield Town Center, 6500 Franconia-Springfield Parkway, from May 20, 2022, through June 5, 2022. See Exhibits 6, 20-21 and 24.
 
On April 11, 2022, Paramount Pictures sent JMC another demand reiterating that JMC must cease its plans to recreate the McDowell’s restaurant, Prince Akeem’s apartment, and Mr. McDowell’s office as seen in the Works. See Exhibit 21.  

On April 28, 2022, JMC counsel responded acknowledging that “this event will also include a temporary fast-food restaurant featuring elements inspired by McDowell’s name, logo, appearance, and menu items.” JMC expressed its position that this use does not violate Paramount Pictures’ copyright rights. See Exhibit 22.
 
On or around May 3, 2022, the parties had another meeting. During this call, JMC’s counsel informed Paramount Pictures’ counsel that their client would run out of money if they were to shut down this operation and proposed executing a written agreement acknowledging that this would be JMC’s last McDowell’s pop-up.
 
On or around May 10, 2022, the parties had a follow-up call to discuss JMC’s proposal. During this call, Paramount Pictures informed JMC that they would not be interested in letting JMC’s pop-up event go forward considering JMC’s first unauthorized pop-up event and the extensive advertising they have implemented for this upcoming event.
 
On May 13, 2022, Paramount Pictures sent JMC’s counsel stating, “[p]lease confirm whether your client is canceling the event or proceeding so my client can plan accordingly.” See Exhibit 23. Paramount Pictures received no response. 
 
On May 27, 2022, Paramount Pictures sent JMC’s counsel another email to confirm whether JMC was proceeding with the event. Id.  Paramount received no response. 
 
On information and belief, JMC’s held the event from May 20, 2022, through June 5, 2022. At this event, JMC offered food packaging and merchandise bearing protected elements from the Works, including but not limited to clothing, frisbees, pens, ornaments, and glassware.  Exhibit 5 and 24. In addition, the Infringing Restaurant utilized express references to the Works including “McDowell’s Zamunda” (a reference to the fictional African nation of the Works and the “McDowell’s Zamunda” restaurant in Coming 2 America), the “Big Mick” (the “Big Mick” featured in Coming to America) and the “McFlurby” (the “McFlurby” featured in Coming 2 America). Id. JMC also used the character Randy Watson (the lead singer of the band Sexual Chocolate from the Works played by Eddie Murphy) on merchandise and visuals in the Infringing Restaurant. Id.","JMC misused Paramount Pictures’ intellectual property to deceive parents and children into believing that the Infringing Restaurant is affiliated with, or authorized by, Paramount Pictures. To make matters worse, the quality of the food is in serious question, as consumers have reported feeling discomfort after eating at the Infringing Restaurant. See Exhibit 25.
 
The foregoing harm is irreparable and is exacerbated by the fact that in the Infringing Restaurants and in associated marketing materials, JMC has intentionally displayed and reproduced the copyrighted images, characters, costumes, and character names, and derivative works thereof, from the Works.  
 
JMC created, displayed, and reproduced the Infringing Materials willfully, and in knowing disregard of Paramount Pictures’ copyrights, of which JMC was on notice long before it began its infringing conduct.
 
On information and belief, all of JMC’s conduct described herein has been and continues to be willful, wanton, and in bad faith, and none has been with the authorization or consent of Paramount Pictures.
 
Federal Copyright Infringement (17 U.S.C. § 501)
 
As stated above, the Works are original works of authorship, and Paramount Pictures is the sole and exclusive owner of all right, title, and interest in and to the copyrights in the Works.
 
The Works, as well as images and names from the Works, have been available in the media and on the Internet for years, and Defendants have long had access to the Works.
 
Images, videos, sets, signage, costumes, character designs, and character names appearing in the Infringing Restaurants, and in related marketing materials are identical or substantially similar to copyrightable material in the Works.
 
Without authorization from Paramount Pictures, JMC reproduced copyrightable material from the Works, displayed reproductions of copyrightable material from the Works, and created derivative works based on copyrightable material from the Works.
 
JMC’s conduct has been willful and in knowing disregard of Paramount Pictures’ rights.
 
Paramount Pictures is thus entitled to recover actual profits, damages or, in the alternative, statutory damages at our election totaling $30,000. Additionally, Paramount Pictures is entitled to attorneys’ fees based on JMC’s intentional and willful acts, and any other additional measures that the Board sees fit."
22-CCB-0111,Stebbins v. Google LLC,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/368,"**SECTION I: BACKGROUND AND FACTS**
I am a Youtuber and Twitch streamer who goes by the alias “Acerthorn.” My Youtube channel can be found at the url of www.youtube.com/c/acerthorn, and my Twitch channel can be found at the url of www.twitch.tv/acerthorn.

On May 16, 2021, I did a live stream on Twitch, which I later transferred to Youtube, known as “Acerthorn's Credibility as a Reviewer (w/ Montyspa on Co-Commentary).” As of the time of this writing, this video can be found at the url of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDKSx4oi-r0.

On January 17, 2022, I registered the copyright for this stream with the Copyright Office. Its copyright registration number is PA0002340792.

At timestamp 2:17:55 – 2:18:23, you can see me giving a smug smile while I put my fingers together in a very smug manner. It is a long video, so to keep you from having to navigate to the timestamp manually, you can click on this link to take you to that timestamp directly: https://youtu.be/iDKSx4oi-r0?t=8275.

There is a Youtube channel called “Acerthorn the True Acerthorn,” or ATTA for short, which is dedicated to harassing me, doxxing me, impersonating me (as evidenced by the channel's name), and infringing on my copyright. This channel can be found at the url of https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGresCRvVSWCu0usvuwU7LQ. 

This channel has posted several videos which infringe on my copyright. Many of these videos are unregistered, which is the main reason I am not filing a claim for them at this moment. However, the channel icon (a circular image that appears next to the channel's name) is clearly a snapshot of the “smug face” mentioned above. This channel icon is a prima facie infringement of my copyright.

Although the channel was originally created on February 29, 2020, it was not always called “Acerthorn the True Acerthorn.” Instead, the owner of this channel changed the name of the channel after deciding to make a hobby out of harassing and impersonating me. It was at this point that he began using the screenshot from my copyrighted livestream. As you can see by viewing the channel, the oldest of his videos was posted on April 10, 2022. It is, therefore, highly likely that his uploading of the infringing icon also occurred on or shortly before this date.

Because the uploading of his icon most likely occurred approximately 83 days after the livestream was registered, the preponderance of the evidence overwhelmingly suggests that the registration predates the infringement, thereby entitling me to statutory damages.

**SECTION II: GOOGLE'S SAFE HARBOR**
On August 3, 2022, I issued a DMCA Takedown Notice to Youtube, asking them to remove the infringing icon. See Attachment #1. 

In the early morning of August 4, 2022, I received a response from Youtube, informing me that Google is actually the company that hosts channel icons on Youtube's behalf, so if I want an infringing icon to be removed, I have to go through Google. See Attachment #2.

So I searched the database on copyright.gov and found Google's DMCA Designated Agent. I found the following listing: https://dmca.copyright.gov/osp/publish/history.html?search=Google+LLC&id=18b733849581703204a3229ddd03c10b. That listing said that the email address for Google's Designated Agent was dmca-agent@google.com.

So I submitted a DMCA Takedown Notice to that email address on August 4, 2022. This takedown notice was fully compliant with the DMCA's requirements for a takedown notice. See Attachment #3.

However, later that same day, Google responded to the DMCA Takedown Notice, stating that they were not going to process the takedown until I provided “additional information.” They never stated exactly what information they wanted me to provide, and even if they did specify, I already provided everything that the DMCA requires me to provide. See Attachment #4.

The DMCA only requires me to provide six things in the Takedown Notice. See 17 USC § 512(c)(3)(A)(i)-(vi). Those six things are … 

(i) A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

(ii) Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site.

(iii) Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material.

(iv) Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which the complaining party may be contacted.

(v) A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.

(vi) A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

As you can see from Attachment #3, I provided all six of these things.

ISPs absolutely do not have the right to demand additional details in a DMCA Takedown Notice, and still keep their safe harbor. Even if they could do that as a matter of law, fundamental fairness would still require them to state with specificity what details they want the claimant to provide. But here, Google not only demanded additional information that I am not required to provide, but they didn't even tell me what exactly they wanted! I was supposed to just read their minds and figure out for myself what additional information they wanted!

Therefore, Google LLC has lost its safe harbor and is vicariously liable to me for the infringement committed by this troll.

**SECTION III: FAIR USE**
Fair use is always something one must consider whenever you're dealing with the infringement of copyright, especially for antagonistic purposes. For this reason, I wish to explain why I believe the infringing icon does not qualify as fair use. I will examine two potential theories for fair use, and explain how I feel the infringing icon fails both theories.

**Sec. III-A: The Icon Itself**
First, the icon itself fails to offer anything of transformative value. Admittedly, there are additions to this image. There appear to be subtitles that contain the words “Acerthorn” and “laws,” but parts of those words have been cropped out, so we have no way of knowing what the original message was. Also, on the left side, you can see part of another man's face.

It is clear that this icon was not an original creation, but was instead cropped out from a pre-existing meme. It is possible that the original meme might have passed for fair use, but without having the full meme in front of us, we have no way of knowing.

But even if the original meme was fair use, this icon still isn't. If you remove everything from a meme that makes it transformative, you lose the right to call the resulting crop transformative in turn. Imagine if I upload a movie clip to Youtube, and I claim that I got the clip from a review of that movie of that movie that I found online. Because that review was fair use, I can use the clip from the movie and have it still be fair use, right?

Not right. That's not how it works. If you remove all the transformative content, you lose the right to claim it is transformative.

Here, ATTA cropped out most of the stuff that could, conceivably, have rendered the meme transformative. What we are left with is a mish-mash of nebulous “stuff” simply slapped onto my face. That is not good enough to be considered fair use. “[T]he addition of new expression to an existing work is not a get-out-of-jail-free card that renders the use of the original transformative.” See Seuss v. Comicmix, , 983 F. 3d 443, 453 (9th Cir. 2020).

Contrast that with ATTA's channel art (as opposed to his channel icon), which you can see by scrolling to the very top of his channel. There, my likeness is positioned in front of a wall of twinkies, with a whole twinkie hanging out of my open mouth. This is a much stronger case for fair use, because the image actually provides criticism and commentary about me! Specifically, ATTA is making fun of how fat I am. This is transformative because it says something about me, not simply slapping some nebulous “stuff” onto the image and calling it a day.

For this reason, the icon fails to qualify as fair use on its own. However, there is one more way the icon might can qualify as fair use, which leads me to … 

**Sec. III-B: The Channel as a Whole**
While the icon may not qualify as fair use all on its own, it may not have to, as long as it is considered part of an otherwise fair use whole. For example, if a Youtube channel is dedicated to covering Star Wars content, then that channel might legally get away with using an otherwise non-transformative picture of Darth Vader as its channel icon. However, in order to get fair use for the icon, the channel itself must be, at least majority, dedicated to fair use content, e.g. movie reviews, story analysis, fan theories, stuff like that. It cannot simply be a repository for otherwise unaltered movie clips.

With that said, let's look at the videos that ATTA has posted. While I am not filing suit over these videos (at least not yet), they are nonetheless relevant in determining whether the channel as a whole can be considered a “fair use channel,” thereby earning a pass for the otherwise nontransformative channel icon.

However, even by this generous standard, ATTA's channel fails miserably to clear the bar. He has only posted nine videos so far. Three of them (the two “Not on the fucking stream” videos, and the “Acerthorn Eats a Fly” video) are entirely unaltered clips, with no new expression (transformative or otherwise) added in. The video “Acerthorn is a doxxer and here's why” is even worse: It is literally just a verbatim upload of an entire video. It isn't even a clip; it's literally the whole video!

Then there's the “Acerthorn Theme Song” video. While the audio of that video is not copyrighted by me (it is instead copyrighted by a musician who goes by the stage name ""Nihilore,"" from whom I have received permission to use his song as my channel's theme song), the visuals are indeed copyrighted by me. Only a few of the images in this slideshow, however, can even nominally be described as “transformative.” The majority of the images of this slideshow consist of nothing more than me sitting in front of the computer and making various faces. Sometimes I am wearing my signature blue shirt and ball cap; other times (such as in the very beginning) I am wearing other clothes. But only a few of these images have made any modifications whatsoever, let alone transformative modifications.

That alone means that five out of nine videos (aka a majority of them) cannot qualify for fair use. So there is no need to discuss the remaining four videos.

It is clear, at this point, that ATTA is not actually concerned with fair use. Any nominal transformative value that ends up on his channel is entirely incidental. It is clear that he is not curating his content based on what is fair use. Therefore, his channel cannot be classified as a “fair use channel.”

This means that the channel icon must qualify as fair use on its own to avoid liability for infringement, which, as I described in Section III-A, it cannot do.

Therefore, the infringing icon is absolutely a blatant case of copyright infringement. There is no two ways about it.

**SECTION IV: CONCLUSION**
Therefore, ATTA committed blatant copyright infringement when he used my channel icon without authorization. This means that Google LLC is now vicariously liable to me for the infringement, since they refused to take the infringing icon down when they had the chance.","$15,000 in statutory damages, both to compensate me for loss of licensing royalties, and also to teach Google a lesson about giving people the run-around after they file technically perfect DMCA Takedown Notices."

The text also included a picture of Nathaniel Ladson standing in front of ""Sunglass Corner"" (with his name on it) hung on a wall at a Georgianna's Joint in Manhattan, NY. 

He has also used ""Sunglass Corner"" as his cover image on Facebook.","As a photographer for over 40 years, ""Sunglass Corner"" is my signature photographic piece. It is the image that I am known for and is easily recognizable as my work. ""Sunglass Corner"" helped to launch my career. It has been published and exhibited widely. I have collectors who have purchased limited editions, valued at $1500 each.

Copying and reproducing ""Sunglass Corner"" in any way, reduces its value. My collectors bought and paid for the emotional sentiment evoked by this image- four elderly men from a different time standing as present day sentries to the Village of Harlem, New York. The high contrast and soft grainy texture is indicative of the style I've created, by using the same materials in processing and printing my images. Reproducing the image cheapens and devalues it tremendously. I've invested years, time and money honing my craft and skill as a self-taught photographer. This infringement has also threatened my reputation as a professional. I can't have the authenticity of my work questioned at this stage of my career.

I have had my attorneys send letters to cease and desist all activities. They've also had phone conversations with Mr. Ladson, that resulted in his denial of any responsibility and ignoring their requests. One attorney described him as ""unhelpful"". He even indicated that he got the image from a book entitled ""Harlem on My Mind"", published in 1968, long before the creation of ""Sunglass Corner"" in 1980, as if that would absolve him of any responsibility of the infringement.

I don't know how many reproductions were made, used sold, published and exhibited, under what circumstances, or what this will do to future sales or my reputation as a working artist. 

Because I have no way of assessing the extent to which he has profited from the infringement, or determine how it will effect my future earnings/career, I am asking the maximum amount of $30,000 to resolve this matter."

22-CCB-0101,Kramer v. Tobias,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/315,"On his web site, Mr. Tobias plagiarized text from my copyrighted article. 

The following text was taken, almost word-for-word, from my article:

The ALFA program begins with AU faculty working with the agency director to identify 1-3 difficult organizational challenges along with identifying an executive sponsor for each challenge. AU faculty then meet with each executive sponsor to assess the suitability of the problem for the Action Learning process; clarify the roles of the AU faculty, executive sponsor, and the team members; and provide guidance in selecting an effective Action Learning team. The executive sponsor for each challenge then selects Action Learning teams comprising 6-7 people each.

Days 1-3:The first three days are classroom-based and focused on developing the leadership competencies necessary to utilize the Action Learning methodology. The class will focus on such skills as active listening, asking powerful questions, reflection, strategic thinking, and problem solving. Each team member is required to select one or more personal leadership developmental goals on which to work during the Action Learning process. Participants are challenged to let go of ingrained perceptions of leadership and problem solving - psychic prisons built over the years that limit our mind's ability to see and solve. This part of the program guides students beyond the ability of taking a step away and viewing a leadership challenge from the outside. Instead, it teaches them to observe themselves observing leadership challenges. Furthermore, it embraces unlearning, taboo topics, questioning, and the sheer beauty of simply not knowing.

Days 4-5: The latter part of the first week, also in the classroom, introduces students to the foundation and structure of the Action Learning model. It is at this point that students begin to couple, in real time, the perceptual changes occurring in Days 1-3, with the structural components of Action Learning, and the context of the identified agency problem(s). By the end of day five, the Action Learning teams have engaged in the necessary steps to fully implement the Action Learning model and have developed a plan for implementation over the next 4-6 months.

Days 6-10:After the initial week, AU Action Learning coaches attend up to five meetings, at the agency, with the Action Learning Teams. This approach ensures teams maintain consistency in using the Action Learning methodology and refines the leadership skills necessary to properly apply the Action Learning process. As Action Learning Coaches continue to meet with the teams, they work to gauge their progress, review individual leadership competency development plans, and assess future steps. Action Learning teams are encouraged to share what's working along with what is not, and make necessary adjustments. Team members are also encouraged to meet on their own as needed and to consider their Action Learning project as a vehicle for bringing to light their capacity as an extraordinary leader, a learning leader, and a teaching leader. With the guidance of AU faculty and coaches, team members are challenged to reflect periodically on the following questions over the course of the Action Learning project:

Are those on the team growing as human beings?

Are they meeting their developmental goals?

Are they more willing to ask questions about their own values, assumptions, beliefs, and expectations?

Are they increasing their ""headroom""?

Are they more likely to become learning leaders in their own right?

Are they willing to experience negative capability?

Is the team proceeding towards making recommendations to address the identified problem?","In 2009, as an independent consultant, I created this award-winning leadership development program, and have offered it ever since then, for a substantial fee, to individual and organizational clients all over the world.  

By copying my text, Mr. Tobias has made it impossible for me to market my program in Washington DC to Federal Government agencies.  Agency clients will purchase Mr, Tobias's program rather than mine, since he has the imprimatur of American University, while I am an independent consultant without the ability to market as intensively as Mr. Tobias.

Additionally, I get paid in all future brand deals based on how many, followers, views and likes my profiles have. 

Doing Things Media, and their subsidiary Doggos Doing Things stole the video from my account, removed my watermarks, and shared it to their own account, amassing over 1.8 million views. They did not appropriately tag me nor ask my permission to use my content. I commented and messaged asking for appropriate credit, at the very least. My followers also began commenting on the post asking them to credit me. They deleted those comments. 

I then emailed them 2 times, once asking them to take the content down and twice with an invoice asking them to simply pay my content fee - the standard fee I charge for usage without watermarks or tagging. 

They are not only making money off my content but stealing my potential income since every like, comment and share is of dollar value.","As a result of this infringement and unlicensed use of Nicole Punzi's likeness, I have lost out on my standard fee of $2775 for limited content use - if a video is to be used in ads I charge an additional $1500 and if it will be used in perpetuity and additional $1000. Additionally, I have lost out on more than 1.8 million views which amounts to $720, or $.04 per view. 

The lost followers, likes, and views cannot be easily quantified because all of my future brand deals will now pay less as they have stolen those follows, likes, and views from me.

I have even received messages and comments on my own account implying that I copied and stole the content from them because people are seeing their content more frequently than my own. I am a small creator and the algorithm favors massive companies and accounts like theirs. So when they steal my content and post it, it inherently suppresses my ability to reach a wider audience."

On December 18, 2019, I discovered that my photograph of one of my original acrylic paintings was being used as the primary advertising photo to sell “BYOB” acrylic pour painting classes at a New York-based company called “The Paint Place” through the website CourseHorse.com.

They posted this photo in affiliation with multiple classes being held at least two different “The Paint Place” art studio locations in the New York City area throughout 2019 and 2020.

According to posts of class listings on CourseHorse.com for “BYOB Panting: Paint Pouring” that had my photograph posted on them, these classes were being sold at a price of $60 per person, had an “average of twenty students” per class, and were often listed as being “sold out”.

This photograph was of artwork that I created as part of an acrylic pour painting tutorial that I wrote and published exclusively on the arts & crafts website FeltMagnet.com on September 4th, 2018.

In June 2019, I registered the painting tutorial that includes this photo with the U.S. Copyright Office. I have since received the copyright registration certificate. (No. TX-794-605)

I was never contacted by CourseHorse.com or The Paint Place to request my permission to use my photo.

As mentioned, I published this photo as part of a tutorial on FeltMagnet.com. It has never been listed with a stock photo agency or made available elsewhere.

It’s unclear whether it is still being used to sell art classes through CourseHorse.com or at The Paint Place, and when the infringement began.

In December 2019, I submitted this infringement case to the company, Pixsy. Pixsy could not resolve the situation with CourseHorse.com and/or The Paint Place and has since discontinued the case.

I have screenshots dating back to December 2019 that show CourseHorse.com/The Paint Place’s usage of my photograph in the manner I described and show that my watermark was removed or cropped out of the images they used.","CourseHorse.com and The Paint Place’s unauthorized commercial use of my photograph of my artwork that I’m using in current and future creative content and marketing not only reduces the value of my photo, but it implies a connection between myself and these companies that doesn’t exist.

The many “BYOB Painting: Paint Pouring” art classes at two New York City art studios being sold on CourseHorse.com and/or The Paint Place for $60 per person with twenty student classes over the course of multiple years, using my photograph as the primary advertising image on their websites, generated revenue for one or both of these companies that I received no compensation for.

Internet traffic to my painting tutorial article that includes this photograph has gone down in the last several years as search engines view a photo appearing on multiple websites as duplicate content and de-prioritize the site in search results, which reduces my earnings from this article.

As a result of CourseHorse.com and The Paint Place’s usage of my photograph on their websites, this photo has circulated online and has been posted on at least two other unaffiliated websites that provided details about these classes being taught at The Paint Place in New York City.

I am seeking $30,000 and complete removal of my photograph from these websites."

Any accounts where our book was being sold would be transferred in our names. The files were never transferred and royalties have not been paid to date. Amazon, Barnes & Noble and Kindle have been selling my book on their sites and sending the money elsewhere. I'm assuming to Kenn Dunn.","Since this is the second time that I've been taken advantage of by a publishing company, this situation took a toll on my mental health. The thought of someone else taking credit and making money off my work made me physically ill and caused severe depression. I was left in financial strains that affected my livelihood and was almost evicted. I've reached out to the online sites to have the files transferred and continue to get an automated response. I paid an estimated amount of $5,000 and have no idea how many books have been sold or the amount that is owed to me. I had to stop promoting my book and take down my websites. This situation also made me an open target to thieves trying to steal my intellectual property and plagiarizing my book on their IG and Facebook pages. I've made both local police and the FBI reports on the people I believe were doing this. I have not sent a takedown notice because I do not wish to have the book removed, I would rather have the account transferred under my name and royalties paid. If that is not an option and the book is taken down, I ask that I be compensated what's owed along with compensation to be able to recreate my dream elsewhere. 3 years is a long time to be at a stand still because of someone else greed."

Since Heart/The Beat is the earliest copyrighted recording of the two, it appears as if significant aspects of Mr. Brown's musical material and ideas, which also appear in ilomilo, have been appropriated by the creators of ilomilo without Mr. Brown's permission and have been incorporated into the recording of that song.""","The respondents' co-opting of my work without attribution has deprived my ability to capitalize on the work.

Claimant first published the Photo less than 24 hours later when he provided it, with others, to his original client (Vox Media) for its consideration (Vox did not choose to use the photograph).
Claimant then licensed the Photo, non-exclusively, to Smuggling Duds on Oct. 1, 2012.
Smuggling Duds added its logos (“Logos”) to the Photo, as permitted under its license, prior to its publication of the Photo.
Smuggling Duds published the Photo with Logos on the Smuggling Duds website, at https://smugglingduds.com/blogs/news/at-the-ufc-weigh-ins-with-dan-the-outlaw-hardy-and-jimi-the-posterboy-manuwa, on October 2, 2012, under its license (it is still visible at that URL). 
The Photo, as it appears on the Smuggling Duds website, contains Claimant’s copyright management information metadata, including his name, address, and other contact information.
On information and belief, the Photo with Logos had not appeared anywhere other than on the Smuggling Duds website prior to the infringement by Respondent.

On information and belief, on or shortly before May 17, 2013, Respondent accessed the Smuggling Duds website and copied the photograph from there. On May 17, 2013, Respondent then published, displayed, and distributed the illicitly copied photograph, with Logos but without the Photo’s original metadata, on its Facebook page. Respondent’s use of the Photo was commercial, to promote a broadcast of a fight which included the subject of the Photo. 

Claimant was oblivious of this infringing use of his Photo until September 6, 2021. In the summer of 2021, Claimant had discovered a few infringements on social media of his photographs of MMA fighters, particularly on Facebook and Instagram. Claimant created a pseudonymous Facebook account for the purpose of looking for other infringements of his work. Thus, he began to run searches of the names of some of the more prominent fighters in his images, to find out if more had been infringed. On September 6, 2021, Claimant performed such a search on Facebook, looking for “Jimi Manuwa” and in so doing first discovered Respondent’s use of his Photo. Therefore, Claimant's claim is timely.","Claimant seeks maximum statutory damages ($15,000).

Mass Appeal Records LLC, et al",https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/227,"Rakeem Calief Myer, using the professional name “Roc Marciano” knowingly infringed on at least two of my fully copyrighted songs from my copyrighted 1969 album titled “Trip Thru Hell” and a 1995 CD release by Sundazed records with the same music and title.

I not only wrote the music I recorded and produced the original album from which he created the derivatives from.

The songs of mine that were used to create the derivatives were “Trip Thru Hell Part 1”, “I Shot the King” and possibly others yet to be discovered (Attachments 1,2,3)

Mr. Myer created a minimum of five derivative works using my copyrighted music on at least two albums he titled “Marcberg” (9 versions including CDs) and “Reloaded” (8 versions including CDs).
There are possibly others yet to be discovered. (Attachments 4,5)

The main derivative works Mr. Myer created utilizing my music and that I have been able to locate thus far are… 
 Thug’s Prayer
 Thug’s Prayer Pt. 2 
I Shot the King
I Shot the King (bonus cut) 
Thug’s Prayer Instrumental

Attachment 6 is a listing of the derivatives Mr. Myer, or the other respondents involved in this claim registered with SoundExchange prior to my discovery of this infringement.

It should be noted that some of the respondents in this claim have since conceded that the infringement occurred and have relinquished any claims that they had previously to the derivative songs with SoundExchange. As a result, SoundExchange has since transferred rights to the derivative song/material to me.  

Mr. Myer created these derivative works on vinyl records and other media to widely distribute them worldwide for profit.
 
He did this directly or through distributors such as Mass Appeal, Fat Beats, Universal Music, Amazon, Apple and others. 

Mr. Myer and the other respondents profited from royalties paid by online internet streaming and downloading services such as YouTube. Spotify and others.

There also may have been some revenues from live performances of the derivative music.

Mr. Myer did this knowingly and intentionally as he was fully aware that the songs were written, recorded and copyrighted by me. 

In April 2007 Mr. Myer using the professional name “Roc Marci”, contacted me through a third party with the intention of obtaining a liscense to use my song ""Trip Thru Hell Part 1"" to create a derivative song called ""Thugs Prayer""

I still have the original emails and the sample mp3 derivative they sent to me titled “Thugs Prayer”

After Mr. Myer made an offer through a third party, he backed off and I was told by his representative that Mr. Myer aka “Roc Marci” had changed his mind and was no longer interested in obtaining a liscense for my song.

At some point after 2007, Mr. Myer changed his professional name from Roc Marci to “Roc Marciano” and in 2010 created an album titled “Marcberg” which included the derivative work Thug’s Prayer” created from my song “Trip Thru Hell Part 1”.
(Attachments 7, 8)

In addition to the vinyl record “Marcberg”, Mr. Myer used the derivative song to make on-line videos called “Thug’s Prayer”.  

The video had over 1.3 million views/streams when I first discovered it October 27th, 2019 (Attachment 9)

From the YouTube videos Mr. Myer created, other people embedded Mr. Myer's video into their YouTube video and an unknown amount of revenue from streaming was generated and collected from on sites such as YouTube and Spotify.

A recent YouTube video made by a third party (who also recognized the infringement) is an excellent example of what occurred (attachment 10 11)

SINCE FIRST DISCOVERING THE INFRINGMENT (October 27th, 2019), I have had YouTube and other streaming services remove the derivative songs/videos made by Mr. Myer and others numerous times for copyright violation. 

After discovering “Thug’s Prayer” on YouTube I was able to locate some of the parties involved and tried to contact them.

They did not respond to phone calls or emails until I sent a cease-and-desist certified letter in 2020.

In March of 2020.  Mr. Myer, through Universal Music and Mass Appeal acknowledged the infringement.

Universal Music immediately pulled Mr. Myer’s albums with the derivatives involved from distribution.

Mass Appeal proposed an unacceptable settlement to me and then told me they would remove all copies from their distribution. 

From March 2020 until today, I have been unsuccessful in negotiating a fair settlement and/or liscense with Mr. Myer through his representatives despite many hours and emails.

At this point I have no choice but to take this action.

More data:
In 2012 Mr. Myer, created the album called “Reloaded”
Again, without my knowledge or authorization, Mr. Myer sampled my song “Trip Thru Hell Part 1” from my album ""Trip Thru Hell"" and created a derivative he called “Thugs Prayer Part 2” (Attachment 12 -13) 

He also created a YouTube video “Thugs Prayer Part 2”, which I have had to remove a number of times from YouTube and other streaming sites.

Mr. Myer sampled another copyrighted song of mine called “I Shot the King"" which was released on the 1995 CD by Sundazed Records. 

In addition, using my song “I Shot the King”, Mr. Myer created a derivative song/video where he actually played my song in the background while he added his own lyrics over it. He called his derivative “I Shot the King” as well. 

This video was placed on YouTube (and others?)  by Universal Music Group and Mass Appeal. Mr. Myer also claimed credit for writing the song in the video. Attachments 14 15 16

Again, without my knowledge or authorization, Mr. Myer sampled my song “Trip Thru Hell Part 1” from my album Trip Thru Hell and created another derivative he called “Thugs Prayer Instrumental.  

I bought and downloaded a copy of the derivative from Amazon” March 12, 2020, for evidence purposes only 17 18 19

Other factors  

I did not discover this copyright infringement until October 27, 2019. 

I left the music business completely in 1974 and had no connection with or knowledge of the industry until I retired in late 2019 when I began to build a YouTube channel for the music that I had recorded many years earlier.

The only connection I had with the music industry between 1974 until 2019 was with the record company Sundazed Records. They licensed my music and re-issued the music on a CD in 1995 as well as two re-issues of the original vinyl album. 

While building the YouTube Channel for my music, I got a message from a listener that another artist named Roc Marciano was sampling/using my music. 

The name “Roc Marciano” sounded similar to a person I remembered had sought to liscense my song “Trip Thru Hell Part 1” in 2007 under the name “Roc Marci”

So, I went back and found the 2007 emails and began the process that has led to where the matter is now.","I am seeking maximum statutory damages, the costs of this action and such other amounts as the Court deems proper and within the limit authorized by this Court.  

The respondents acts of infringement were not only willful, intentional, and purposeful, but also in complete disregard of and indifference to claimants’ rights. Accordingly, claimant is entitled to judgment in its favor and against each respondent, jointly and severally, for statutory damages, in the discretion of the Board.

By failing to obtain Petitioner’s authorization to use the Copyrighted Work or to compensate Petitioner for their various uses, Respondents have avoided payment of license fees and other financial costs associated with obtaining permission to exploit the Copyrighted Work, as well as the restrictions that Petitioner is entitled to and would place on any such exploitation as conditions for Petitioner’s permission, including the right to deny permission altogether
The Respondents have certainly gained an undeserved and unknown amount of revenue/profit from the derivatives by exploiting my original music.

This has caused an immeasurable amount of damage, damaging credibility, sullied my original work and required hundreds of hours of my time to identify the source and scope of the infringement as well as the parties/respondents (thus far identified) involved. 

The creation and exploitation of the unauthorized derivative work also has induced, facilitated, and encouraged further downstream infringement.   

Until a settlement agreement (if any) is signed, I reserve the right to require different and/or additional terms and conditions to settle this matter.
And, unless and until a settlement is signed, I reserve all of my rights and remedies and Rakeem Calief Myer, using the professional name Roc Marciano or other respondents has no rights to use any portion of my recordings and compositions."

Plaintiff declined TNT request for an interview but allowed for the use of the cover of his book (What Is Real? (Rare Bird Books, 2018)). Plaintiff denied the use of the copyrighted photographs that were requested. 
When the Rich & Shameless episode aired on 4/23/2022 on TNT and HBO Max, Plaintiff noticed that the TNT producers used his copyrighted work in their television show after having denied TNT a licensing right.","Plaintiff is seeking statutory damages.

It is best for Plaintiff to seek statutory damages of $30,000 in this venue as it would be a laborious and costly legal fight to seek disgorment of profits of Respondents attributable to their infringement and to include the value of all gains, advantages, benefits of Respondents would exceed the $30,000 limit that this board is authorized to adjudicate."

I received a payment in 2011 of $3,497, and in 2012 I got $935.40 and in 2013 $809.60, but then the payments stopped.

I’ve not heard from you, although on December 16, 2020 you said you would get back to me within a week.  I really don’t like to get attorneys involved, but I now have bids from three different New York law firms that are ready to pursue this matter.  Certainly it will cost end up costing you $$$ in attorney’s fees.  It’s pretty open and shut.  

The easiest way out is for you to inform the management and owners of Mud Puddle that they owe me 10 cents for every Joy of Juggling book sold since they/you stopped sending payments.

Otherwise I’ll have to pull the trigger on the lawsuit and nobody will be happy except the attorneys.

So you can see that he does acknowledge the debt but has not followed through.

Although it is nowhere near the amount owed, if I can get $5,000 from him I will call the debt of the past 10 years paid.  Then I would like to have Mud Puddle Books stop selling my book or enter into a new agreement to actually make the payments as agreed.","I entered into an agreement in good faith and Greg Boehm fulfilled as agreed for a few years and then stopped.  $5,000 is nowhere near the amount owed, but it would be sufficient.

They purposely ignored the nearly twenty minutes of compelling evidence presented in my video and further called me an idiot, that I would be pissing my pants and various other derogatory terms while quickly dismissing me and my work to potentially their five plus million subscribers. To date this video has over 1.16 million views in four months.

This compilation is the result of over ten years of dedicated work in this field. I have been on national television twice on CNN and the Travel Channel and am slated for a profile on the History Channel's The Proof Is Out There this fall.

The reckless and vicious comments and cherry picking of tiny segments of my original work had been devastating to me personally and has caused grace damage to my name and my YouTube channel. 
I feel compensatory and punitive damages of $30,000 is appropriate in this case.

John Martin","The fact that over a million viewers have now seen my work, with my name and YouTube channel notated at the bottom of the first video clip from their hatchet work to my good name has caused and grave long term harm to me and me work. The fact that they chose to ignore all the other compelling evidence on the compilation video that they culled for their supposed debunking evidence is proof of ill will and malice towards me that was completely unprovoked from me. Indeed, I only just happened to find out what they had done while viewing various YouTube clips on the subject and recognized my work."

Etsy refuses to remove the offender and offending content from their platform even after receiving numerous complaints of copyright infringement from various sellers for the offender, Etsy is allowing this shop owner to sell not only my copyrighted works but others as well. 

Ive contacted etsy over a dozen times to no avail and no response. 

Etsy then allowed this person to relist my content and retaliatory remove my shops content, and allowed the user to list  myself my name and my address for sale as an item in her shop for $10 and as far as I know you cannot sell human beings. 

Etsy also allowed this person to defame my character and write 1 star reviews of my content claiming that it was poor or not my own. The extent of the harassment's forced me to close my shop and to have to close permanently thus loss of business on not only etsy but every shop I own. 

Etsy knows that the content in question is mine because I sent video evidence of the content and my shop predates the one in question my content is time dated and stamped as had been upload 2 years prior to this other shop having one so its virtually impossible for her to be said original owner.","I suffered extreme mental and physical ailment due to the harassment and bullying, The stress and anxiety and the incredible amount of loss of sleep due to the strain of having my art stolen.

22-CCB-0060,"Stebbins v. Twitch Interactive, Inc.",https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/172,"There is a Twitch user who currently goes by the username jelmerve334. You can find his account by going to the URL of www.twitch.tv/jelmerv334. 

On or around March 20, 2022, I noticed that he was using my copyrighted Channel Icon #6 as his channel icon without my authorization, and so on March 20, 2022, I issued a DMCA takedown to Twitch asking for it to be taken down. However, Twitch did not take the infringement down. They replied to my DMCA Takedown Notice and asked that I provide proof that I actually own the copyright to this icon.

This is not a valid request. 17 USC § 512(c)(3)(A)(i)-(vi) sets forth six things that a DMCA Takedown Notice must include. I included all six of these things and can easily provide proof thereof once this case gets underway. At no point does the DMCA require me to provide proof of copyright ownership when I issue a DMCA Takedown Notice. The law does not entitle the ISP to request additional details, other than those set forth in § 512(c)(3)(A)(i)-(vi), to verify an otherwise statutorily-compliant takedown notice.

It was not until May 10, 2022 that it was finally taken down. This means that Twitch allowed the act of infringement to continue for a total of 51 days.

This unreasonable delay in processing the DMCA takedown is, in my opinion, grounds for a loss of safe harbor. To qualify for safe harbor, Twitch must ""act  expeditiously to remove or disable access to"" the infringing material upon receiving a statutorily-compliant DMCA takedown notice. The keyword, here, is ""expeditiously,"" an important qualifier which Twitch has utterly failed to comply with.

There is no fair use defense applicable here. The individual infringer did not transform my icon in any way shape or form. He was just using it for his own channel. That is copyright infringement at its most blatant.","See my section on ""describe the infringement."""

2) I o/b/o Kirbyko Music LLC issued a takedown on the unlicensed music use via Content ID.
3) Mr. Chen filed a false counter-notification with YouTube, under penalty of perjury,  in order to release the legitimate strike, which causes monetization on his YouTube channel to be turned off. This is a common tactic by ex-US YouTube streamers because they know that reaching them with litigation is nearly impossible.
4) I emailed Mr. Chen directly asking him to remove his false counter-notification. He has not replied.
5) per the DMCA I now have only a few days' time in which to file a suit against the false counter-notification.
6) I do not know the original date of infringement as I believe this film (created in China) has existed for some time, and now this YouTube channel has acquired the streaming rights to it. However, the underlying musical score - my work ""Boxed-Up Memories"" - is unlicensed and is the commercial copyright infringement at issue here.
6) Mr. Chen wrote the following to YouTube in order to expedite the removal of the copyright strike:

Videos included in counter notification:

Display name of uploader: 网络电影院

We are the authorized distributor of this movie. We have acquired rights to use this music in it. We can provide all legal authorization documents. Please retract the strike as soon as possible. Thanks.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good faith belief the material was removed due to a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.

I consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the district in which my address is located, or if my address is outside of the United States, the judicial district in which YouTube is located, and will accept service of process from the claimant.

When I reached out to Mr Shellenberger to request that he renew the license he refused.  He has ignored my requests to remove the images and continues to offer them as downloads from his website.  At least one of my images was being used to make t-shirts for Mr Shellenberger's campaign.","The majority of my work comes from referrals both direct and indirect.

22-CCB-0050,Jarman v. SHEIN Distribution Corporation,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/120,"My photos of my fairy wings creations were used without permission and reproduced as stickers in a booklet that SHEIN is selling on their website.
A friend recognized one of them and messaged me to ask if it was my photo, and indeed it was my photo from my Titania Painted Fairy Wings Etsy listing, the copper / rose gold colored one as seen here: https://www.etsy.com/listing/171521829/titania-iridescent-fairy-wings-with?show_sold_out_detail=1&ref=nla_listing_details. 

She sent me the listing (1st url provided above in previous section) and there I could see small thumbnail photos, of my Titania wings and also my green painted Teasel Fairy Wings.
I'll call that one Sticker Book A.
The photo of my Teasel Fairy Wings design can be seen in my old Etsy listing here:
https://www.etsy.com/listing/60733733/teasel-iridescent-fairy-wings-with

They're selling those sticker booklets containing my Titania and Teasel fairy wing photos for $2, described as '50pcs Scenery Pattern Random Material Paper'.
So far it has 1773 customer reviews, indicating at least that many purchases.

I then found another sticker book listing containing the same Teasel Fairy Wings photo that is in the first sticker book.
That listing is the second link provided above in the 'where the alleged infringing acts occurred'.
I'll call this one Sticker Book B. It's listed as '50pcs Mixed Pattern Sticker'.
That item has 2441 customer reviews and is being sold for $1.50 each.
Both of these properties are wing designs that I sell digital overlays for on my website currently and used to sell physical wearable versions of, however they use different photos.
I have never sold to SHEIN and even if they did purchase the overlays, this use violates my terms of use as I do NOT allow commercial use such as this where the stand-alone image of the wings is distributed in any format.

In addition, SHEIN features models on their website and on their Instagram wearing what I can identify as knock-offs of my Titania Fairy Wings design. They don't appear to be made by me, as I can see small differences in the construction that never appeared in my own work.
For example, in these listings:
https://us.shein.com/ROMWE-Fairy-Grunge-Allover-Mushroom-Print-Frill-Trim-Shirred-Cami-Dress-p-10292813-cat-1727.html?src_identifier=st%3D2%60sc%3Dgrunge%20fairy%60sr%3D0%60ps%3D1&src_module=search&src_tab_page_id=page_goods_detail1657513343041&attr_ids=&scici=Search~~EditSearch~~1~~grunge_20fairy~~~~0

The knock-off wing copies also appear in this Instagram post:
https://www.instagram.com/p/CfhYe88vuPw/","I am the only company that sells these fairy wings designs in any format, and did not license SHEIN to sell these images.
SHEIN is profiting off of my IPs without permission or payment to me, which deprives me of potential licensing income from my own IP.
The sales of my images as cheap stickers dilutes their value, and when in addition they're displaying models wearing knock-offs of those designs, it implies to the public that I am collaborating with their company somehow when I am absolutely not.
In fact, I would not choose to work with this company as the entire economy of 'fast fashion' and the negative impact it has on the environment conflicts with my values.
I am seeking the maximum amount of damages that the CCB deems I should be awarded, should they decide in my favor."

22-CCB-0041,"RealToonTV Productions & Entertainment LLC v. Smiley, et al",https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/87,"On Thursday September 30th I, John Davis, CEO of RealToonTv Productions & Entertainment LLC gave Larry Smiley- El also known by the alias “Siyf Smiley,” the files to my documentary, MurdaWorth “The Story of How Gangs came to Texas” (which contains my image, likeness, and copyrighted intellectual property) in order to clean the sound, which he told me was his speciality after I had interviewed him. 

On October 7th I was informed that Larry Smiley was finished editing the files and was subsequently paid for the services rendered; However I never received my files. Some time after that Siyf quit returning my calls.

On October 7th I sent Brian Hall a copy of the rough draft that syfe had completed, so that he knew what was going on with the project and for feed back. 

 
On October 11th Larry Smiley sent a request for permission to view a second project that I was working on through google drive; the only other person to have been given access to view the project was Brian Hall also known by the alias Bob MCGRIFF (Supreme).  When questioned about the odd request Syfe came up with an elaborate story of how a hacker hacked his gmail account some time ago and sometimes sends emails from the account at random.  

On October 16th I was made aware that Larry Smiley had a private meeting with Brian Hall. 

In this meeting they plotted to steal my intellectual property and release it on KOTF a network owned by Larry Smiley; a move that I would have been totally against. 

Essentially, Brian Hall promised Siyf that he would allow him to release the project through his network, if Larry Smiley gave him the documentary files that I paid him to edit. Larry  agreed to the terms. It is also important to note that I haven’t received anything even though I’m the one who gave Larry Smiley the files, and paid him to edit them. 

After receiving the files Brian Hall blocked me from all of his social media account.  He did this the day he released an unauthorized trailer to the documentary; which is where I learned that the project would be released “exclusively on the Urban Fire Binge Network;” a subsidiary of KTOF, the network owned by Larry Smiley.  

I was never notified about the trailer from Brian Hall or Larry Smile, nor was I consulted with about the distribution of my project. 

A Texas blogger informed me that the trailer was out and sent me a link to watch it. I tried to click the link he sent but couldn’t because I was blocked. The reason I believe I was blocked was because Brian Hall tried to conceal what he was doing from me. 

I have put in over 3 long years of blood, sweat, and tears in to this project. I have also carried 100% of the financial burden of the project.

I have made several attempts to reach out and get the files that I paid him for, however he has done nothing but make excuses, avoid calls, and do shady businesses. 

The documentary has been uploaded several times on a non authorized YouTube channel that Brian created; so not only is he stealing my intellectual property but unbeknownst to him he’s not even getting paid for it.

I have released a cease and disist letter to immediately stop, prevent, and remove any distribution of my copyrighted intellectual property from from said party’s. 

On October 23rd
I attempted to have a neutral third party, as a mediator between me and supreme, as a show of good faith However, Brian was belligerent, yelled, cussed, and screamed like a self righteous child and hung up the phone on me

Since that time I’ve had the documentary removed twice from supremes YouTube. 

Let me be very clear. I never verbally agreed to any partnership with Brian nor have I agreed to this in written form. As a matter of fact I have a signed non Disclosure agreement with him as an employee of my company 

I have chosen to bring a claim against Larry Smiley and Brian Hall because he intentionally stole the files I gave him, slapped his logo on the project claiming ownership, and lastly he issued a copy right strike from my YouTube account for the project as if he was the rightful owner.

Brian Hall is on contract saying he is the owner of the project with a distribution company.","3 Years of Hard work, thousands of dollars, chronic stress, and time wasted dealing with this."

22-CCB-0033,Barton v. Pirnia,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/70,"On Friday, May 1, 2015, I answered an ad on Craigslist with the headline: “Narrative Script Needed ASAP.” The description said an experienced documentary producer was seeking a writer for an hour biography/documentary show. I sent a resume in response. (I worked at E! Entertainment Television on the non-fiction series “Celebrity Profile” and “True Hollywood Story,” and had written several award show red carpet scripts for TV Guide Network.) 

I heard back quickly from the producer, Tara Pirnia. She needed a short turnaround on a script for a show about the fashion evolution of Kate Middleton. When I quoted a price of $1000, she talked me into lowering it by half to $500, saying that it was the pilot for a series and she would pay me more for the next script. I agreed. 

She sent me a rough outline that included bullet points for each segment, divided up into nine blocks plus a cold open. After researching and writing the script, I submitted my first draft with my original title “Kate Middleton: Duchess of Style.” Tara praised my work in subsequent emails. She seemed pleased with my writing. I stayed in touch with Tara during the revision process, and she gave me additional notes which I incorporated. I submitted an invoice, but never received payment. At one point she mentioned getting me a contract, but none ever materialized. 

In the ensuing weeks and months, my repeated requests for compensation from Tara Pirnia never resulted in any funds being forwarded to me, despite many promises to do so and several statements that she had already wired the funds to me or sent a check. Sometimes payment was promised within 24 hours. Other times my emails were ignored until I sent repeated follow-ups. She was angry when I contacted her partner Tony Taglienti to alert him to the non-payment issue. My last email to her is dated September 14th, 2015. An invoice was attached and she responded saying she would pay me soon. A copy of the invoice and out entire email chain is attached. 

To this date, no contract, payment or other communication has ever been received by me. As a precaution, I registered my script for “Kate Middleton: Duchess of Style” with the U.S. Copyright office in 2015.  

During 2020, the first year of the pandemic, I discovered that there was a six-episode series called “Style Queens” streaming on Amazon Prime. The first episode was about Kate Middleton. Tara Pirnia was listed as director and executive producer. A quick viewing let me know that this was the show that I had written. I transcribed the show and realized that the majority of the script—especially the narration—was my original copyrighted work. A transcription is attached, with any added or changed words in red.

It turned out that “Style Queens” was now available on multiple platforms including DVD. “Style Queens” is distributed by MVDVisual, Discovery, and NBCUniversal. Promo sheets are attached. 

Tara Pirnia had attended a red carpet event for the launch of ""Style Queens"" at a fashion event in Austin, Texas. Press coverage is attached. A Spanish version showed up on DirectTV Latin America. It promoted her career while I was left unpaid and uncredited. The script was credited to “Dan Brown.” That is not my name. 

And she was not done exploiting and exhibiting my script. She directed another hour-long royal fashion episode called “Meghan Markle: Duchess of Style.” (That title sound familiar?) The opening (which was also used as a trailer) is word for word my script opening for Kate Middleton, with only Meghan Markle’s name and identifying details swapped out. IMDBPro lists the current distributor as Discovery+.

In the provided documents, I will show a chain of title on the copyright that accompanied all episodes of “Style Queens,” including the pilot episode on Kate Middleton. It will show that my copyrighted script was made into a show that was copyrighted by someone else without my permission.","I am entitled to damages because this was no accident. Tara Pirnia has practiced this kind of fraud and deception before. In documentation which I will attach I will demonstrate that she has a history of legal actions being brought against her to collect on rents, wages, and other monies that went unpaid due to her repeated deliberate actions meant to defraud others. Copies of these complaints are attached, as well as a list of all small claims cases brought against her.

As recently as 2021, a complaint was filed by Amanda Raymond, the writer and director of a feature film Tara Pirnia produced. The cause of action was breach of contract. In the complaint the Amanda Raymond states that Tara Pirnia had no intention of paying the deferred compensation, contingent compensation or travel expenses as outlined in her contract. A copy of the complaint is attached. 

In my case, Tara Pirnia took one script I wrote and used it for two shows. She then resold these shows around the world in streaming and international distribution deals, including DVDs. While her career advanced into the area of directing feature films, with accompanying self=promoting interviews and red carpets, my contributions to these went uncompensated and without a contract. I was unable to claim them as credits in order to obtain similar freelance opportunities. I was unable to reap the benefits as well as payment for the more lucrative assignments she had promised in our initial communication. 

I have concluded that Tara Pirna practices fraud and deception as regular means of doing business. She never sent me a contract for me to negotiate residuals or other compensation, including credit. Despite my requests, she never supplied me with any contact information other than an email address. She took my work and exploited it with flagrant disregard for copyright law. She may continue to do so unless this board reminds her that there are consequences to undermining the rights of creators such as myself. She must be strongly discouraged from violating copyright again. 

I am seeking $5,000 in damages for each incident of copyright violation on my scriopt for ""Style Queens: Kate Middleton"": Amazon Prime Streaming, DirectTV Latin America, international distribution via NBC Universal, Roku Channel, Tubi, and DVDs from MVD Visual and currently for sale via retail outlets such as Walmart and Target. This totals $30,000. I would also like full credit on IMDB and on screen for my script for ""Style Queens: Kate Middleton."""
22-CCB-0032,SAPA v. PUKA CREATIONS LLC,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/69,"Copying and producing, advertising,distributing and selling my copyrighted designs, Selling my designs thru their website, in person sales at their business location, and offering for sale, copies of my original design at major trade shows throughout the USA.","The infringer was afforded many opportunities to contact me thru online communication.A formal cease and desist letter and multiple DMCA take down notices were issued to their web host. The defendant is knowing of the infringement and willfully continuing to disregard the law. They have willfully failed to communicate and cease their copyright infringement. Copies of these designs have been found on Etsy and Amazon. My main source of income comes from sales on the Etsy platform. The financial harm caused by competing with unauthorized copies of my designs is one concern. Copies of my designs are being placed into brick and mortar establishments because the defendant is selling these designs through large, national trade shows. This distribution is allowing retailers to sell infringing goods throughout the world. Their actions are causing unknowing retailers to resell infringing goods and also leading them to copyright infringement claims. Because I voluntarily do not sell at a wholesale level, it has caused irreparable damage to the uniqueness of my designs. When a consumer sees unauthorized copies of my design in a retail establishment, the design is not considered to be an artistic work any longer. That is the reason I do not sell at a wholesale level. I want my works to be considered ""artistic"" and sold on a venue such as Etsy, which caters to those seeking artistic items. The defendant also sells cheap items sourced from China. I do not want my designs to be associated with such merchandise. That also causes harm to my design uniqueness. When a buyer sees my design on etsy but then sees it at a convenience store or amazon, there is harm caused to the exclusivity of my design. I am seeking statutory damages as the harm caused cannot be measured by looking at sales alone. There is also a large emotional toll it has taken upon me dealing with these legal matters as well as seeing my works being copied. The hummingbird design was created in memory of my deceased mother and to see this work copied is disgusting and unpardonable. I want the sales of infringing items by the defendant to cease immediately and any merchandise that violates my copyrights I want destroyed. I also request the defendant, at their expense,  to recall the infringing works from anyone they sold or transferred the infringing works to. I am requesting the maximum monetary award available for willful infringement. I am aware I could seek a larger amount of damages in federal court and make other requests which would likely be granted but I want this to be resolved more quickly without bankrupting the defendant in legal fees. Should the defendant not want to cooperate at this level I will have no other choice but have my attorney file this case in the regular federal court setting."

22-CCB-0015,"Morly Investments Pty Ltd (imprint: The High Street Publishing Company) v. The Walt Disney Company, et al",https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/289,"The author is a minority female writer based in Australia. 

Disney-Hyperion, an imprint and/or subsidiary of the other two respondents, sublicensed the rights to the two titles in question from the author’s primary publisher, HarperCollins Australia via its UK sibling entity, HarperCollins UK (“HCUK”) on 23 September 2010. The author sought a reversion of those rights back from Disney-Hyperion to HarperCollins due to repeated contractual breaches by Disney-Hyperion. Rights were reverted as between Disney-Hyperion and HCUK effective 29 July 2014. On 31 January 2022, HarperCollins Australia reverted the rights to the two titles in question under the head agreement to the author who, on that date, assigned the copyright in those two titles to the claimant. Both HarperCollins Australia and HarperCollins UK have since confirmed to the author and claimant in writing that all rights in the 'Mercy' Series (including Mercy and Exile) by Rebecca Lim have been reverted to the author by both entities and that the author is free to dispose of rights in her works as she will. 

On 5 March 2022 (Australian time), the author discovered that Disney Publishing has continued to distribute the two titles, in breach of US copyright laws, for a period of nearly 8 years.

Following discovery, the author sent repeated emails to the sub-rights department of Disney-Hyperion at cp.dpw.subrights@disney.com and the claimant also emailed two different representatives of Overdrive, Inc to have the ebook versions taken down. Overdrive, Inc. finally removed the Works from distribution on 10 March 2022 (Australian time) and this can be confirmed with Overdrive. Documentary evidence of distribution in breach of copyright by Disney Publishing via Overdrive has been retained by the claimant and can be provided.

Disney has put the author at risk of lost sales and earnings and exposed her works to ongoing piracy during the period they should no longer have been available.

As noted, the claimant has no way of accounting for the electronic distribution channels Disney continued to distribute the two works through during the infringement dates noted above. The Board will appreciate that Disney are hugely well-resourced and well-staffed, and failed to follow standard industry protocols when book rights revert - the files for both of the titles in question should have been destroyed at their end and removed from their systems in July 2014. Disney should not have continued to retain the files in order to 're-animate' them at will, which is what they have done.","The claimant seeks statutory damages of $7,500 per title ($15,000 in total for this proceeding) as the continued existence, availability and distribution of the Disney-Hyperion versions have caused reputational damage to the author, lost sales to the author, exposed the author to continued piracy (over a period of successive years, both the author and the claimant have issued multiple DCMA takedown notices from Australia in relation to the Disney version of the titles) and competed with the claimant's own re-issued editions of the two titles. The claimant cannot prove, based on the claimant's relative lack of bargaining power, its jurisdiction of domicile and inability to seek proper discovery and accounting from Disney, through which channels Disney has distributed the two titles, and how Disney has profited from the infringements."

The work was removed but more infringing content was discovered in April 2022. Dolls Kill sent another takedown notice and the work was allegedly removed from Defendant's website.

On June 15, 2022 Dolls Kill discovered several additional copies on Defendant's websites. It thus appears that Defendant willfully and repetitively infringes upon Dolls Kill's rights, despite Dolls Kill's efforts to resolve this issue without court intervention.","By reason of the foregoing, Defendant has infringed and continues to infringe, the Dolls Kill Copyrights in violation of, without limitation, the exclusive rights of reproduction and distribution and the exclusive right to prepare derivative works under section 106 of the Copyright Act, and section 501 of the Copyright Act.

Those instructions provided to EssayZoo by the customer included material for which I own the copyright, namely, instructions and paper prompts for an essay that students are required to write in a course that I teach.

This claim is not being brought against EssayZoo due to their storage of or referral or linking to infringing material posted by others. The infringing material was not posted directly by the customer in this case. Instead, that material was submitted by the customer to EssayZoo through fillable forms available on the latter's website, as part of the process by which the customer ordered written work from EssayZoo, and EssayZoo later posted the customer's instructions along with (1) a preview of the work produced for the customer, and (2) an option to download the entire work for $4.32.

In addition, even if this claim were being brought against EssayZoo due to their storage of or referral or linking to infringing material posted by others, EssayZoo would not qualify for a safe harbor under 17 USC § 512.

The same IP, Titania Fairy Wings, has actually been infringed 3 different times by Paris Hilton / 11:11 Digital. 
The first time I became aware of one on Instagram, I sent a DMCA notice to Paris' company, at management@parishiltonentertainment.com on 9/17/2020 for the Sept. 2020 infringement, as that was the one I became aware of first, requesting removal of the infringing work from Paris' Instagram account. I received no response, but it was removed roughly a week later after gaining over at least 800,000 views.
That content used the wing image directly from my listing graphic for the digital overlays I sell for the purpose of photo editing, seen in my store here: https://fancy-fairy-wings-things.myshopify.com/products/titania-fairy-wings-transparency-stock-png-files
An error is showing for the documents I'm trying to attach which show how my work was used, but you can see more details in a blog post I made about it here: https://www.fancyfairy.com/news/2020/9/17/infringement-is-not-hot-paris-hilton

The 2nd time I noticed an infringement, was in early December 2020. This image used the same IP, from an older image of my work that appeared on my old website and on social media and had been illegally edited and distributed as stock years ago by someone on Deviant Art. I sent a DMCA on 12/12, again asking for removal.
This time I received a response from someone named Megan Fargo who claimed to be from Paris Hilton Digital. 
They stated that a fan made the edits, that they found my fairy wings image on a free clip art site, but did not remove the infringing content.

I tried sending a dmca to Instagram for the content, not expecting them to actually remove it as their reporting system is inconsistent and tends to favor large accounts, however they did remove the infringing post for copyright infringement.
I sent a dmca for the same infringing image on her Facebook page and one to Twitter, but the dmca was refused on both of those services so the content has remained up.
I again wrote a blog post with details of the infringement, which you can see here: https://www.fancyfairy.com/news/2020/12/12/thats-not-hot-paris-part-2-copyright-hullabaloo

I learned of the 3rd infringement on April 10 of this year, although this one was actually the oldest. Since my previous request for removal was ignored, I did not send a dmca for the one I found in April. This used the same wing image as the December 2020 infringement.
I believe some of these posts may have been monetized with Facebook Watch and Twitter & Instagram bonus systems.","The use of my IP by Paris Hilton companies has harmed my market, by exposing it to potentially millions of people without my name attached. My infringements of this IP have increased greatly in the last 3 years but especially in the last 2. I believe these infringements played a part in that by giving Paris' viewers the impression that my IP is a freely available work to use should they find it being distributed (illegally) online.
I believe it may also be causing brand confusion between myself and a competing fairy wing maker, HelloFaerie, who engaged in slandering me a few years ago when she was trying to compete in the market. HelloFaerie has been providing Paris with her fairy wings for the last 2 or 3 years. Her business was built upon the foundation my work created.
Since these infringements, I have been incorrectly credited or tagged as the wing maker in posts showing HelloFaerie's work quite a few times.
This has been adding insult to injury.
I am seeking roughly $12,000 in relief, based on previous copyright settlements for online displays of my work and due to the frequency with which the same IP has been infringed by Paris / 11:11 Digital."

Sarkes Tarzian, Inc.",https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/3,"Respondent reproduced, displayed, and distributed unauthorized copies of Claimant’s Photograph on its website, wrcbtv.com. In addition, Claimant believes that WRCB-TV, which is an NBC Television affiliate, obtained the Photograph from some other entity within the NBC family of companies, which had many years earlier licensed the Photograph from Corbis/Getty Images. That license expired before WRCB-TV’s use and required the crediting of Claimant in connection with the license. Therefore, at the time of Respondent’s reproduction, display, and distribution of the Photograph on its website, Claimant had not granted Respondent any license or permission to reproduce, publicly display, or otherwise use the Photograph for any purpose. Further, Respondent omitted Claimant’s name from the infringing article, despite the expired license requiring authorship credit, therefore, inducing, facilitating, and encouraging further downstream infringement.

Respondents operate a print shop in Denver, Colorado that creates custom vinyl prints and offers large format printing and design services.
