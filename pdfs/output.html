</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">claimant, and Charles is listed as Manahan’s authorized representative.</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">  A claimant who is not an author or named copyright owner of the allegedly infringed work must provide some specific details or supplemental documents explaining how the claimant owns, or has an exclusive license to use, the exclusive rights at issue.  The claim does not present facts that indicate that Manahan is a proper claimant.   To correct this issue, your amended claim must include specific allegations about how the claimant owns, or has an exclusive license to use, the work at issue.  For example, if Charles exclusively licensed the work (or the exclusive rights at issue) to Manahan, then Manahan would be an appropriate claimant and the amended claim should state that the work was exclusively licensed to Manahan.  Alternatively, if Charles is the copyright owner and has not given Manahan exclusive rights to the work or assigned the rights to Manahan, then the amended claim should change the name of the claimant to Peyton Maree Charles.  Or, if Charles and Manahan are actually the same person and use one of the names as a pseudonym or alias, you should clarify that relationship by including one of </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">the names in the “Alias” field of the Claimant</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> section. </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Substantial Similarity</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> Your infringement claim does not include enough facts that explain the similarities between your work and the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">respondent’s allegedly infringing work</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">s.  If it is not readily apparent from supplemental documents that are submitted with the claim, you must provide some specific allegations about how your work and the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">respondent’s </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">works are substantially similar. </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">In the “Describe the infringement” section of the claim, y</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">ou </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">state that “</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Respondent used several clips from my published content on Youtube without consent</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">” and “</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Respondent has repeatedly used my content</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">.”  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">However, your claim does not provide detailed information describing how any of </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">respondent’s</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> videos are substantially similar to your work.  For example, you do not identify which clips from your work were used, or how many, or for how long.  In addition, you provided a copy of your work as a supplemental document, but you have not provided the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">respondent’s work for comparison</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">.  As a result, the claim does not provide enough information for the Board to evaluate the similarity of the works.  When you submit an amended claim, it must include more factual allegations that support the element of substantial similarity.  Please provide more details and background regarding this element in your amended claim, including a clear, detailed statement regarding how much of your work was taken by the respondent in the allegedly infringing videos, or documents that are sufficient to show the similarities.  If you include copies of the works at issue as supplemental documents, they must be clearly labeled and identified so they can be properly compared to each other.
