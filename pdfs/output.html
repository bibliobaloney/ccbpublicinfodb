You do not include any information about how the respondent had access to your work.

Acceptable allegations of access may include how your work (a) was sent directly to the respondent or a close associate of the respondent; (b) was widely disseminated or was available </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">to the respondent; or (c) is so strikingly similar to the respondent’s work that the respondent could not have created </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">it independently.

If someone has accused you of infringing their copyright, a noninfringement claim requests an official declaration that you did not infringe.  The claim must identify the party that accused you of infringement and must describe your allegedly infringing activity, the reasons why you believe no infringement occurred, and the reasons why you believe there is an actual controversy about the requested declaration.  37 C.F.R. §§ 222.2(c)(8)(i) &amp; (iii)-(v).  Your noninfringement claim does not clearly state facts that meet those requirements.  In fact, the information you have included with the noninfringement claim appears to assert another claim of copyright infringement against the respondent.  To assert a claim of infringement about another work, you should include the relevant allegations in the copyright infringement section of your claim. </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">The claim for allows you to add multiple works in the “Work infringed” section of the claim and you can describe each instance of infringement in the “Describe the infringement section of the claim.”</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">  You should make sure that, if you add more infringement allegations to your copyright claim, you address all four of the elements of copyright infringement noted above. If you are, instead, asserting a claim of noninfringement, you must specifically describe an actual dispute between you and the respondent over whether your activities infringed </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">the respondent’s copyright, and why you <span style="position:absolute; border: black 1px solid; left:190px; top:2259px; width:173px; height:0px;"></span>

Your claim is not compliant because it provides conflicting information about which entity or individual made a misrepresentation in a takedown notice or counter-notice to an online service provider.   In your claim you name the respondent, Joesph Torrence, as both the sender of the takedown notice and the counter-notice.  A copyright owner can provide a takedown notice to an online service provider, notifying them that someone posted infringing content on the service </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">provider’s system or network and demanding it be taken </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">down.  Once the content is taken down, the person or company that posted the content may get it reposted by sending a counter-notice to the service provider.  Typically, the counter-notice states that the content was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification and asks that the content be reposted.  It is unlikely that the respondent was both the sender of the takedown notice and the counternotice.  In your amended claim you must clarify who sent the original takedown notice and who sent the counter-notice.  You should also include both the notice and the counter-notice as supplemental documents.
