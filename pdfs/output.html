Your claim does not provide enough clarity about the three elements further detailed below.  Please provide more details and background regarding these elements in your amended claim.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Infringing Activity </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">—</span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px"> Clarity </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> Your claim does not present enough facts to clearly state how </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Italic; font-size:12px">each</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> respondent used any exclusive rights you have in the allegedly infringed work without permission.  Copyright law grants exclusive rights to copyright owners.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">These include the right to reproduce, distribute, and publicly perform the work, and to make a “derivative work,” </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">which is a work based on the original work.  Someone who does one of those activities without the copyright </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">owner’s permission may be infringing the copyright, unless they have a legitimate defense.  More information about </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">exclusive rights is available on page 3 of the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Starting an Infringement Claim</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> chapter of the CCB Handbook.  <span style="position:absolute; border: black 1px solid; left:241px; top:1113px; width:159px; height:0px;"></span>
You have brought a claim alleging that two respondents infringed your work; however, the claim does not include a clear statement of the infringing activity of each respondent.   In your claim, you give what appears to be a lengthy chronological narrative of the publication of the work and </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">include some allegations of unauthorized distribution.  You state that “</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">I have seen my copyrighted e-book in the Kindle Store.  All of this without my permission.  I saw Ingram&#x27;s name posted on an on-line marketplace website publicly displaying a copyrighted image of my property/hardback book on-line using my exact words for about this book without my permission.</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">” </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> However, you have not included a clear statement that gives a clear overview of the allegedly infringing activities of each respondent.   To address this issue, your amended claim must include a clear statement of how each respondent infringed your work along with the chronological narrative you have provided.  You should consider focusing your narrative on statements that go through the elements of copyright infringement as discussed below so that you can say what you own, how a specific respondent gained access to your work, what they did that was an actual violation of your copyright rights, and, if the works are different, how their allegedly infringing work is substantially similar to your work.. These statements do not need to be more than a few sentences as you should focus on the infringing activity and should include enough facts to explain how </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">each</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> respondent personally copied, distributed, performed, or prepared derivative works based on your work, or participated in any such infringing activity.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Access </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> Your claim does not provide facts about how Kindle Direct Publishing of Amazon had access to your work.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“Access” means a </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">reasonable opportunity to view or hear your work before the alleged infringement took place.  Not all parties need to have had direct access to your work, to the extent that they were involved in the infringement of the work with persons who did have access, but your claim must have facts that clearly link the respondent that did have access to the work and the other respondent. To address this issue, you must file an amended claim with allegations that make access a reasonable possibility, not just hypothetically or theoretically possible.  Acceptable allegations of access may include how your work (a) was sent directly to the respondent or a close associate of the respondent; (b) was widely disseminated or was available <span style="position:absolute; border: gray 1px solid; left:0px; top:1734px; width:612px; height:792px;"></span>
<div style="position:absolute; top:1734px;"><a name="3">Page 3</a></div>
</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">to the respondent; or (c) is so strikingly similar to the respondent’s work that the respondent could not have created </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">it independently.  You can also give specifics on how the respondents worked together to the extent you show access for one and therefore what might amount to a chain of access.  Alternatively, you can upload copies of your work and the allegedly infringing work if they demonstrate that the works are so strikingly similar that they could not have been created independently</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">—</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">however, this must still show access as described above related to each respondent in your claim and related to the specific infringing actions that respondent took.  If you include copies of the works at issue as supplemental documents, they must be clearly labeled and identified so they can be properly compared to each other. </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Substantial Similarity </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> Your claim also does not include enough facts that explain the similarities between your work and the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">respondent’s allegedly infringing work.</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">  If it is not readily apparent from supplemental documents that are submitted with the claim, you must provide some specific allegations about how your work and the allegedly infringing work are similar. Your claim states that your work is </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">an illustrated children’s book.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">You also state that the respondents are </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">publicly displaying a copyrighted image of my property/hardback book on-line using my exact words for about this book without my permission.</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">”  However, in the “Describe the infringement” section of the claim you state that “</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">I saw changed front covers of my coloring book and my color paperback on Bowker&#x27;s site</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">,” which indicates that </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">you are alleging some changes were made to your work.  You have not included a clear statement that explains the extent of the alleged changes or the remaining similarities between the two works.  Further, it is unclear if the supplementary documents included with the claim include your work and the changes you have alleged. Also, as explained above, it is unclear exactly what you are claiming was infringed.  For instance, if you are claiming that the respondent made unauthorized copies of your entire book, you should state that clearly.  If, however, the respondent had legitimate copies of your book that it was merely selling or re-selling, that would not be a copyright infringement.  If your claim is instead that they copied the cover of your book but made changes to it, you should describe both how the use was an infringing use and the similarities between your copyrightable expression (as opposed to mere ideas) and the allegedly infringing work.   In sum, the claim does not provide enough information to enable the respondent to understand the claim and respond to it.  If you submit an amended claim, it must include more factual allegations that support the element of substantial similarity.  Please provide more details and background regarding this element in your amended claim, including a clear, detailed statement regarding which portions of your work were taken by the respondent in the allegedly infringing work, or documents that are sufficient to show the similarities.  If you include copies of the works at issue as supplemental documents, they must be clearly labeled and identified so they can be properly compared to each other.  However, you should only upload the documents necessary as the Board and the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:11px">respondent cannot be expected to go through dozens of attachments to find the relevant information.
