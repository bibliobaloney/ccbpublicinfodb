However, the claim does not clearly indicate that the Betta Trading Co. image is an allegedly infringing work, and the claim does not state or show that Matthew Amescua has any relationship with Betta Trading Co.  If you file an amended claim, you must describe in as much detail as possible how Amescua allegedly infringed your work.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Infringing Activity </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Your claim must include facts that indicate that the respondent engaged in some activity infringing your copyright, such as reproducing, distributing, or publicly displaying your </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">work, or making a “derivative work,” </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">which </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:11px">is a work based on the original work.

Office (USPTO) for the purpose of registering that work may violate USPTO regulations or trademark law, it does not constitute copyright infringement.  If you submit an amended claim, it must more fully explain how the respondent infringed the copyright in your work.  You should be as detailed as possible, specifying what the respondent did in relation to the work you allege was infringed. </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Access </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Your infringement claim does not provide facts that indicate how the respondent had access to your work before the alleged infringement</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">.  “Access” means a reasonable opportunity to </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">see or copy your work before the alleged infringement took place.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">You assert that the respondent “[r]</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">egistered essentially the same fish as mine to the USPTO</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">” and “[s]</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">howed me where he purchased the work.</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">”  However, you do not indicate when or where the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">respondent purchased his work, or how he obtained a copy of your work before the alleged infringement.  Your claim does not describe anywhere that your work has been published, or present enough information to indicate how it is reasonably likely that the respondent had access to your work before he created his work. To address this issue, you must file an amended claim with allegations that make access a reasonable possibility, not just hypothetically or theoretically possible.  Acceptable allegations of access may include how your work (a) was sent directly to the respondent, or to a close associate of the respondent; (b) was widely disseminated or available to the respondent; or (c) is so strikingly similar to the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">allegedly infringing work that the respondent’s work </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">could not have been created independently.  Alternatively, you can upload copies of your work and the allegedly infringing work if they demonstrate that the works are so strikingly similar that they could not have been created independently.  You uploaded a copy of your work with the claim, but you did not clearly identify any other image </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">presented with the claim as the respondent’s work. </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> If you include copies of the works at issue as supplemental documents, they must be clearly labeled and identified so they can be properly compared to each other.   </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Substantial Similarity</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> Your infringement claim does not include enough facts that explain the similarities between your work and the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">respondent’s allegedly infringing work. </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> If it is not readily apparent from supplemental documents that are </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">submitted with the claim, you must provide some specific allegations about how your work and the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">respondent’s </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">work are substantially similar. You assert that the respondent</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">’s work is</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">essentially the same fish as mine.</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">” </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> However, your claim does not provide detailed information describing how the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">respondent’s</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> image is substantially similar to your image.  In addition, as discussed above, you provided a copy of your registered work as a supplemental document labeled </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">IMG_5417.jpeg</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">, but you have not </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">clearly provided the respondent’s work for comparison;</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> your claim includes <span style="position:absolute; border: black 1px solid; left:36px; top:1550px; width:77px; height:0px;"></span>
other images of betta fish, but none of those images are clearly labeled or identified </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">as the respondent’s work</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">.  As a result, the claim does not provide enough information for the Board to evaluate the similarity of the works.  When you submit an amended claim, it must include more factual allegations that support the element of substantial similarity.  Please provide more details and background regarding this element in your amended claim, <span style="position:absolute; border: gray 1px solid; left:0px; top:1734px; width:612px; height:792px;"></span>
<div style="position:absolute; top:1734px;"><a name="3">Page 3</a></div>
including a clear, detailed statement regarding how much of your work was taken by the respondent in the allegedly infringing work, or documents that are sufficient to show the similarities.  If you include copies of the works at issue as supplemental documents, then as discussed above, they must be clearly labeled and identified so they can be properly compared to each other.

</span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Harm Suffered</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> Your infringement claim must include a statement describing the harm you suffered as a result of the alleged infringement.  37 C.F.R. § </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">222.2(c)(10).  In the “Description of harm suffered and relief sought” section of the claim, you state: “</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Lost two USPTO applications.
