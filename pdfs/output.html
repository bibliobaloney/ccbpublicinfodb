A supplemental document filed with the amended claim appears to show an email signed </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“Villalobos Body”</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> with the user name displayed as </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Wolfgang Body</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">,” but no allegations describe the relationship </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">between Body and Wolfgang Amadeuz.

A legal owner is an author of the work who owns the exclusive rights at issue or a person or entity that has received a transfer of those rights, for example, by an assignment or an exclusive license.  A beneficial owner is a legal owner who has transferred the rights at issue but retains some of the advantages of ownership, such as the right to receive royalties from the use of the work.  A claimant who is not a named copyright owner of the allegedly infringed work must provide some specific details or supplemental documents explaining how the claimant owns, or has an exclusive license to use, the exclusive rights at issue.  More information about legal and beneficial ownership is available at page 4 of the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Starting an Infringement Claim</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> chapter of the CCB Handbook. <span style="position:absolute; border: black 1px solid; left:153px; top:1356px; width:159px; height:0px;"></span>
If Body is an author or co-author of the Interview, you may include that information in a second amended claim. Otherwise, you must include specific factual allegations about how Body owns, or has an exclusive license to use, the exclusive rights at issue in either work.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">You can do this either by adding facts to the “Describe the infringement” section explaining how </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Body owned exclusive rights in the work at the time of the infringement, or by submitting supplemental documents.  For example, you may state how Body became a </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Italic; font-size:12px">legal</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> owner or co-owner of the copyright, such as by assignment or exclusive license; or how Body remained a </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Italic; font-size:12px">beneficial</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> owner after transferring legal ownership, such as by retaining a right to receive royalties from use of the work.

To address this issue in a second amended claim, you must add allegations that make access by the respondent a reasonable possibility, not just hypothetically or theoretically possible.  Acceptable allegations of access may include how your work (a) was sent directly to the respondent or a close associate of the respondent; (b) was widely disseminated or was available to the respondent; or (c) is so strikingly similar to the respondent</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">’</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">s work that it could not have been created independently.  Alternatively, you can upload copies of your work and the allegedly infringing work if they demonstrate that the works are so strikingly similar that </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">respondent’s work</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> could not have been created independently.  If you include copies of the works as supplemental documents, they must be clearly labeled and identified so that they can be properly compared to each other.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Substantial Similarity</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> Your copyright infringement claim does not include enough facts to indicate how the allegedly infringing work is substantially similar to original, expressive elements of your work that copyright protects.  To address this issue, if you file an amended claim, it must include more information about your work, the allegedly infringing work, and how creative elements of the works are similar.   You allege that </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">the respondent “use[s] </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">content owned by me on her youtube channel</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">.”</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">  However, no allegations in the amended claim describe the Interview or any allegedly infringing work, or how they may be identical or substantially similar.  In addition, you have not provided copies of the Interview or the allegedly infringed work as supplemental documents.  As a result, the claim does not provide enough information to enable the respondent to understand the claim and respond to it. If you submit a second amended claim, it must include factual allegations that support the element of substantial similarity.  Please provide more details and background regarding this element, including a clear statement regarding whether the allegedly infringed work took your entire podcast or only a portion, and which portions, or documents that are sufficient to show substantial similarity in material that copyright protects.  If you include copies of the works at issue as supplemental documents, then as discussed above, they must be clearly labeled and identified so they can be properly compared to each other. </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Noninfringement Claim </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">–</span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px"> Clarity</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> As the September 18 Order explained, your noninfringement claim does not clearly state facts that indicate that there is an </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“actual controversy” between the parties over whether you infringed the respondent’s copyright: “It</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> does not clearly detail how the respondent Danielle Robertson (Robertson) has accused you of infringement.  . . .

A misrepresentation in a counter-notice only violates section 512 of the Copyright Act if the OSP relies on it to restore the allegedly infringing content.  Information in your claim indicates that the alleged misrepresentation could not have been a factor in any decision by the OSP to restore the content because the OSP had not restored the material at issue at the time you filed your claim.  You state that a takedown notice was sent to YouTube (the OSP) on August 29, 2024.  The document filed with your amended claim shows that on September 15, 2024, YouTube informed you that it had received a counter-notice (dated September 7, 2024), and YouTube informed you then: </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">You have 10 US business days to reply to this counter notification.  . . .  After 10 US business days, if we don</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">’t</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> get a response from you, the content at issue may be reinstated to YouTube</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">.”  The document also shows that you </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">responded to YouTube on September 17, 2024.  You filed this claim on September 13, 2024, and you amended the claim to add the misrepresentation claim on September 20, 2024.  The timing of the counter-notice and the claim <span style="position:absolute; border: gray 1px solid; left:0px; top:3418px; width:612px; height:792px;"></span>

If YouTube had restored the allegedly infringing material by the time you raised the misrepresentation claim on September 20, 2024, your second amended claim must state facts about that restoration.  However, if YouTube had not restored the allegedly infringing material in reliance on the counter-notice by that date, your misrepresentation claim cannot move forward. Because your misrepresentation claim is based on an alleged misrepresentation that does not appear to have been relied on by an OSP before the claim was filed, we have not reviewed the remainder of your misrepresentation claim to determine whether it complies in all other respects with the legal and formal requirements for a claim before the Board.  If you submit a second amended claim that resolves the issue, the Board will engage in a full compliance review, so you should review the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">CCB Handbook</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">, including the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Starting an Misrepresentation <span style="position:absolute; border: black 1px solid; left:246px; top:3667px; width:82px; height:0px;"></span>

Statutory damages are a form of relief available for copyright infringement, but not for misrepresentation.  Moreover, the Board does not enhance damages awards based on willfulness.
