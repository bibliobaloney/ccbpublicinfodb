</span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Legal or Beneficial Ownership </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> Your claim provides conflicting facts about the claimant&#x27;s status as a legal or beneficial owner of the allegedly infringed work.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">To bring a copyright infringement claim before the Board, the claimant must be “the legal or beneficial owner of the exclusive right [in a copyrighted work] at the time of the infringement.”</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">  17 U.S.C. § 1504(c)(1).  A legal owner is an author of the work who owns the exclusive rights at issue or a person or entity that has received a transfer of those rights, for example, by an assignment or an exclusive license.  A beneficial owner is a legal owner who has transferred the rights at issue but retains some of the advantages of ownership, such as the right to receive royalties from the use of the work.   The claim does not present facts that indicate that Super Cichlids Inc is a proper claimant.  A Board search of Copyright Office records shows that Lisa Hoeber is listed as the author and copyright claimant of the work.  A claimant who is not an author or named copyright owner of the allegedly infringed work must provide some specific details or supplemental documents explaining how the claimant owns, or has an exclusive license to use, the exclusive rights at issue.  To correct this issue, your amended claim must include specific allegations about how the claimant owns, or has an exclusive license to use, the exclusive rights at issue.  You can do this either by </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">adding facts to the “Describe the infringement” section explaining how the claimant was the owner of exclusive rights in the work at the time of the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">infringement or by submitting supplemental documents.  For example, you may describe the relationship between Super Cichlids Inc and Lisa Hoeber or detail how the claimant obtained legal or beneficial ownership of copyright.  If the information in the claim identifying the claimant or the authors of the work is inaccurate, you may correct that information in an amended claim by deleting Super Cichlids and adding Lisa Hoeber as the claimant.  More information about legal and beneficial ownership is available at page 4 of the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Starting an <span style="position:absolute; border: black 1px solid; left:470px; top:1344px; width:55px; height:0px;"></span>

</span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Access </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> Your claim does not provide facts about how the respondent had access to your work.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“Access” means a </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">reasonable opportunity to view or hear your work before the alleged infringement took place.  In your claim, you </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">state that “</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">our original video content was illicitly downloaded, edited to obscure our trademarked product, and subsequently re-uploaded to the YouTube platform</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">” but do not include any additional allegations about how the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">work was available to the respondent. To address this issue, you must file an amended claim with allegations that make access a reasonable possibility, not just hypothetically or theoretically possible.  Acceptable allegations of access may include how your work (a) was sent directly to the respondent or a close associate of the respondent; (b) was widely disseminated or was available to the respondent; </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">or (c) is so strikingly similar to the respondent’s </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">work that the respondent could not have created it independently.</span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:11px"> Alternatively, you can upload copies of your work and the allegedly infringing work if they demonstrate that the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">works are so strikingly similar that they could not have been created independently.

While you have attached to your claim what appears to be the infringed video but it is not </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">labeled as such and a copy of respondent’s video is not</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> attached.  As a result, the claim does not provide enough information to enable the respondent to understand the claim and respond to it.  When you submit an amended claim, it must include more factual allegations that support the element of substantial similarity.  Please provide more details and background regarding this element in your amended claim, including a clear, detailed statement regarding which portions of your work were taken by the respondent in the allegedly infringing work, or documents that are sufficient to show the similarities.
