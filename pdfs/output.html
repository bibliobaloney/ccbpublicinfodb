You uploaded a number of unlabeled .jpeg files and screenshots as supplementary documents.  The unlabeled supplementary documents may depict a copy of your works, or screenshots of the allegedly infringing works, but it is hard to tell.  You do not provide any other information describing or depicting the individual works, stating whether a particular work is one of your allegedly </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">infringed works or one of respondent’s allegedly infringing works, </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">or stating or showing how they are identical or substantially similar.

As a result, the claim does not provide enough information to enable the respondent to understand the claim and respond to it.  When you submit an amended claim, it must include more factual allegations that support the element of substantial similarity.  Please provide more details and background regarding this element in your amended claim, including a clear, detailed statement regarding which portions of your work were taken by the respondent in the allegedly infringing work, or documents that are sufficient to show the similarities.  If you include copies of the works at issue as supplemental documents, they must be clearly labeled and identified so they can be properly compared to each other.
