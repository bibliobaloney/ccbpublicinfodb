publishing company has been selling your book, and that you searched and found that the respondent had republished your book in January 2021. Those allegations do not clearly describe an infringing act by the respondent that could be the basis of this claim.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">You describe the respondent as your book publisher, which suggests that some or all of the respondent’s </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">activities were authorized.   In addition, your claim cannot proceed based on any alleged infringing activities that you knew about or should have known about more than three years ago.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">A “statute of limitations” is a time limit set by law for starting a </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">claim.  The statute of limitations period for copyright claims, both in federal court and the Board, is three years after </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">the claim “accrues.” </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> 17 U.S.C. §§ 507(b) &amp; 1504(b)(1).  A claim for copyright infringement accrues when the infringing act occurs, or when the claimant discovers, or with due diligence should have discovered, the infringement.  A proceeding before the Board cannot be commenced more than three years after the claim accrued.  17 U.S.C. § 1504(b)(1).  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Your allegations indicate that you knew about the respondent’s initial publication of your </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">book on Amazon, and that any claims related to that use on Amazon in that time period accrued no later than February 21, 2017, and cannot be the subject of this infringement claim.  New infringing acts would open a new three-year window for raising a claim, because a new statute of limitations period starts for each new incident of infringement; however, your claim does not clearly indicate that any recent publication by the respondent was unauthorized. If you submit an amended claim, it must include more facts that indicate which acts by the respondent you consider infringing.  The amended claim should state whether you ever authorized the respondent to publish your book, and if you did, you must also state facts that indicate why and how any publication or distribution by the respondent has gone beyond the scope of what you authorized.  It should also state what actions or investigation you took when you stopped receiving payments in 2017 and why you did not take action before 2017 when you were receiving payments for potentially unauthorized sales.  Finally, you should explain what you mean by </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">a different publishing company</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">”</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> publishing your book and what relationship that company has to the respondent, because if this respondent is not involved in the infringement, a claim cannot be brought against the respondent for copyright infringement.   Also, your claim names an individual as a respondent, and your allegations do not clearly distinguish that individual from the business entity that published the book.  If you file an amended claim, include specific facts that indicate how the named respondent personally played a role in any infringing activity.
