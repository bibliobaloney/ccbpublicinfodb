As an initial matter, it is unclear if you mean these to be one respondent or two </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">respondents.  If two, they should be split out as separate respondents.

Those inconsistent allegations must be corrected in an amended claim.  In general, your claim must more specifically and clearly state what each respondent did to infringe your works.  You may attach documentation to your amended claim, such as screenshots of your work and the supposedly infringing actions, to make this clearer.  Also, special rules apply to infringement claims brought against OSPs, which provide online services to store (and make available), refer to, provide access to, or link to material that is available online.

To bring a copyright infringement claim before the Board, the claimant must be “the legal </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">or beneficial owner of the exclus</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">ive right [in a copyrighted work] at the time of the infringement.”  17 U.S.C. § </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">1504(c)(1).  A legal owner is an author of the work who owns the exclusive rights at issue or a person or entity that has received a transfer of those rights, for example, by an assignment or an exclusive license.  A beneficial owner is a legal owner who has transferred the rights at issue but retains some of the advantages of ownership, such as the right to receive royalties from the use of the work.  A claimant who is not an author or named copyright owner of the allegedly infringed work must provide some specific details or supplemental documents explaining how the claimant owns, or has an exclusive license to use, the exclusive rights at issue.  The claim does not present facts that indicate that Triple Crown Publications is a proper claimant.  A Board search of Copyright Office records shows that</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:9px"> </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Vickie M. Stringer is the copyright claimant of the registration listed in the claim.  Even though you may be the owner of Triple Crown Publications, the law considers entities to be separate from the individuals who own them.  Because the copyright claimant listed on the registration certificate is not the entity named as claimant in the proceeding and you have not included any additional information about the ownership of the copyright rights, your claim may not proceed.  To correct this issue, your amended claim must include specific allegations about how the claimant owns, or has an exclusive license to use, the exclusive rights at issue.  To correct this issue, you can either (1) amend the claim to </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:11px">name yourself (Victoria Stringer) as claimant instead of Triple Crown Publications or (2) provide additional </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">information about how the copyright is actually owned by Triple Crown Publications, or was exclusively licensed to <span style="position:absolute; border: gray 1px solid; left:0px; top:1734px; width:612px; height:792px;"></span>
