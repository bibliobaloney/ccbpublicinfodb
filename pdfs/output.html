The claim cannot move forward unless it is amended. </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">If you wish to proceed with this claim, you must file an amended claim by </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">February 28, 2025</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">.  If you do not, <span style="position:absolute; border: black 1px solid; left:400px; top:334px; width:88px; height:0px;"></span>
</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">the Board must dismiss your claim without prejudice, although you may file again in the future before the Board or in federal court.  If you file an amended claim and it is found compliant, you will be notified and directed to proceed with service.  There is no additional filing fee for an amended claim.  17 U.S.C. § 1506(f)(1)(B). To make your amended claim compliant, you must resolve the issues identified below.  37 C.F.R. § 224.1(c)(2).  You may also choose to correct or edit any errors or other information in your claim before you file it again.  For </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">example, it appears that the respondent’s name </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">is misspelled </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">in the “Respondent” section; if </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">it is misspelled, you should correct it when you file the amended claim. You do not need to provide a legal argument in your claim </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">–</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> just a statement of facts and circumstances.  Being specific in your description gives the other party and the Board more information about your claim.

You allege infringement of a photographic image and you assert that the respondent displayed the image as part of a YouTube thumbnail for several YouTube videos.  However, you do not detail how the respondent had a reasonable opportunity to view or copy your photograph.  To address this issue, you must file an amended claim with allegations that make access a reasonable possibility, not just hypothetically or theoretically possible.  Acceptable allegations of access may include how your work (a) was sent directly to the respondent or a close associate of the respondent; (b) was widely disseminated or was available to the respondent; or (c) is so strikingly similar </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">to the respondent’s work that the respondent could not have created it independently.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> Alternatively, you can upload copies of your work and the allegedly infringing thumbnail images if they demonstrate that the works are so strikingly similar that they could not have been created independently.

For example, you do not indicate how much of your photograph appeared in the allegedly infringing thumbnail.  You also have not provided copies of your photograph or of the allegedly infringing thumbnail images as supplemental documents.  As a result, the claim does not provide enough information to enable the respondent to understand the claim and respond to it.  When you submit an amended claim, it must include more factual allegations that support the element of substantial similarity.  Please provide more details and background regarding this element in your amended claim, including a clear, detailed statement regarding how much of your work was taken by the respondent in the allegedly infringing works, or documents that are sufficient to show the similarities.  If you include copies of the works at issue as supplemental documents, they must be clearly labeled and identified so they can be properly compared to each other.

If someone has accused you of </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">infringing their copyright, a noninfringement claim requests an official declaration that you did not infringe.  To </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">proceed with such a claim, there must be an “actual controversy” between the parties over whether </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Italic; font-size:12px">you</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> infringed </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Italic; font-size:12px">the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Italic; font-size:12px">respondent’s</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> copyright.  28 U.S.C. § 2201(a); </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Italic; font-size:12px">see</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> 17 U.S.C. § 1504(c)(2).

Your noninfringement claim does not state facts that meet those requirements.  Instead, your allegations in the noninfringement claim contend that the respondent infringed your work, not that </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Italic; font-size:12px">you</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> were accused of infringement.

To raise a noninfringement claim, the work listed in that field </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">should be the respondent’s work, not your work.</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> Infringement claims and noninfringement claims are very different types of claims.  A noninfringement claim is not another place to raise your allegations that your copyright was infringed.  If the respondent has not accused you of infringement, you must omit the noninfringement claim from any amended claim that you choose to submit.  Your noninfringement claim can only go forward if you present facts in an amended claim that indicate that there is an actual controversy between you and the respondent over w</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">hether your acts infringed the respondent’s copyright.</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">   </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Misrepresentation</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> You are also bringing a claim of misrepresentation in connection with a counter-notice under 17 U.S.C. § 512(f).  That kind of misrepresentation has a very specific meaning under copyright law, which involves false statements made to an online service provider (OSP) related to a copyright-protected work posted online.   </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Your claim must make enough factual allegations to support each “element” of the claim.  The elements of </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">misrepresentation that apply to your claim are: 1.</span><span style="font-family: ArialMT; font-size:12px"> </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">The respondent sent an OSP a counter-notice, denying the claim of infringement in a takedown notice, and claiming the online content was removed or disabled due to a mistake or a misidentification, 2.</span><span style="font-family: ArialMT; font-size:12px"> </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">The respondent made a misrepresentation (a false or incorrect statement of fact) in the counter-notice, 3.</span><span style="font-family: ArialMT; font-size:12px"> </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">The respondent knew the misrepresentation was false or incorrect, 4.</span><span style="font-family: ArialMT; font-size:12px"> </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">The misrepresentation was important to the OSP’s decision to restore the content, and</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> 5.</span><span style="font-family: ArialMT; font-size:12px"> </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">You were harmed as a result of the OSP’s decision to repost the content.</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> 17 U.S.C. § 512(f).  A misrepresentation in a counter-notice only violates section 512 of the Copyright Act if the OSP relies on it to restore the allegedly infringing content.     </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">There is no allegation in the claim that the OSP (YouTube) restored the content.  Without such an allegation, </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">your misrepresentation claim cannot go forward.  Moreover, information in your claim suggests that the OSP would not have restored the content based on the alleged misrepresentations by the time that the claim was filed.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“Safe harbor” provisions in section 512 </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">of the Copyright Act protect certain OSPs from paying damages for infringement claims if they restore allegedly infringing material, ten to fourteen business days after receiving a proper counter-notice, unless they first receive notice of an infringement claim filed against the alleged infringer in court or before </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">the Board.  More information is available on the Copyright Office’s</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">section 512</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> page.

takedown notice to YouTube on January 14, 2025, requesting removal of the allegedly infringing images, and that the respondent sent a counter-notice to YouTube on January 21, 2025.  You filed this claim before the Board four days later, on January 25, 2025.  The proximity of these dates suggests that YouTube would not have reinstated the material at the time you filed your claim, less than ten business days after the counter-notice. <span style="position:absolute; border: gray 1px solid; left:0px; top:2576px; width:612px; height:792px;"></span>

If YouTube had restored the allegedly infringing images before you filed this claim on January 25, 2025, your </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">amended claim must state facts about that restoration.  However, if the respondent’s </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">works had not been restored in reliance on the counter-notice by that date, this misrepresentation claim cannot move forward, and you must omit the misrepresentation claim from any amended claim that you choose to submit.
