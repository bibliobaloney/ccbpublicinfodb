If you file an amended claim, it must include enough details about the elements for the Board and the respondent to understand the facts of the alleged infringement. </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Legal or Beneficial Ownership</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> The claim does not present clear facts that indicate that you personally are a proper claimant to bring this infringement claim, rather than Ethereal Co LC (Ethereal), the copyright owner identified in the registration.  If you submit an amended claim, it must clarify the discrepancy. <span style="position:absolute; border: gray 1px solid; left:0px; top:1734px; width:612px; height:792px;"></span>
<div style="position:absolute; top:1734px;"><a name="3">Page 3</a></div>
3 </span><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size:12px"> </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">To bring a copyright infringement claim before the Board, the claimant must be “the legal or beneficial owner of the exclusive right [in a copyrighted work] at the time of the infringement.”</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">  17 U.S.C. § 1504(c)(1).  A legal owner is an author of the work who owns the exclusive rights at issue or a person or entity that has received a transfer of those rights, for example, by an assignment or an exclusive license.  A beneficial owner is a legal owner who has transferred the rights at issue but retains some of the advantages of ownership, such as the right to receive royalties from the use of the work.  A claimant who is not an author or named copyright owner of the allegedly infringed work must provide some specific details or supplemental documents explaining how the claimant owns, or has an exclusive license to use, the exclusive rights at issue.  More information about legal and beneficial ownership is available at page 4 of the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Starting an Infringement Claim</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> chapter of the CCB Handbook. <span style="position:absolute; border: black 1px solid; left:215px; top:1943px; width:159px; height:0px;"></span>
When you submitted your claim, you certified that you were the legal or beneficial owner of rights in the allegedly infringed work</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">.  However, the Copyright Office registered the work under Ethereal’s name.  The </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Certificate of Registration for VAu001516484 does not list you as an author or copyright claimant of the registered pictorial works.  Instead, it lists Ethereal as the author and copyright claimant of the works, which are identified as </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">works made for hire.  The “Works infringed” section of the claim also lists Ethereal as the author and describes the work as a “styled photoshoot by Ethereal Co LC.” </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">For legal purposes, the author of a “work made for hire” is not </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">the individual who actually created the work.  Instead, the party that employed or commissioned the individual to create the work is considered both the author and the copyright owner of the work.  If information in the claim identifying the claimant or the author of the work is inaccurate, you may correct that information in an amended claim.  For example, if Ethereal is the owner and author of the registered works as </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“works made for hire,” the amended claim should name Ethereal as the claimant instead of Andrea B. Cregger.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> However, if you personally are the copyright owner, you must include specific allegations about how you own, or have an exclusive license to use, the exclusive rights at issue.  You can do this either by adding facts to the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“Describe the infringement” section explaining how you owned exclusive rights in the work at the time of the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">infringement, or by submitting supplemental documents.  For example, you may describe your relationship with Ethereal and state how you obtained legal or beneficial ownership of copyright, such as by assignment or exclusive license.  If you include copies of an assignment or license as a supplemental document, they must be clearly labeled and identified.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Access</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> Your claim does not provide facts that indicate </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">how the respondent had access to your work.  “Access” means a </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">reasonable opportunity to view your work before the alleged infringement took place.  Your claim does not clearly state allegations about where or how the allegedly infringed photographs were available before the alleged infringement so that the respondent had an opportunity to see them.   <span style="position:absolute; border: gray 1px solid; left:0px; top:2576px; width:612px; height:792px;"></span>
<div style="position:absolute; top:2576px;"><a name="4">Page 4</a></div>
4 </span><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size:12px"> </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">To address this issue, you must file an amended claim with allegations that make access a reasonable possibility, not just hypothetically or theoretically possible.  Acceptable allegations of access may include that your work (a) was sent directly to the respondent or a close associate of the respondent; (b) was widely disseminated or was available to the public or respondent; or (c) is so strikingly similar to the respondent</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">’</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">s work that they could not have been created independently.   Alternatively, you can upload copies of your work and the allegedly infringing work if they demonstrate that the works are so strikingly similar that they could not have been created independently.  Image files included with your claim appear to show certain allegedly infringing photographs used by Oneiro Photography, but you have not clearly indicated which of those photographs are allegedly infringed works within the VAu001516484 registration.  In addition, you have not included copies of your works that you allege were infringed.  If you include copies of your works </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">and respondent’s works</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> as supplemental documents, they must be clearly labeled and identified so they can be properly compared to each other.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Substantial Similarity</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> Your claim also does not include enough facts that explain the similarities between your work and the allegedly infringing work.  If it is not readily apparent from supplemental documents that are submitted with the claim, you must provide more specific allegations about how your work and the allegedly infringing work are similar. </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">In the “</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Describe the infringement</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">” section, you state that “</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">[m]y photographs are being used for advertising without my permission </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">is using our photos,” but you do not clearly describe the extent of that use.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">The claim does not clearly describe the allegedly infringed works or include them as supplemental documents, and does not clearly identify which works used by respondent are the allegedly infringing works.  As a result, the claim does not provide enough information to enable the Board to understand the similarity of the works.   If you submit an amended claim, it must include more factual allegations that support the element of substantial similarity.  Please provide more details and background regarding this element in your amended claim, including a clear, detailed statement regarding which of your works or portions of works were taken by the respondent in the allegedly infringing works, or documents that are sufficient to show the similarities.  If you include copies of the works at issue as supplemental documents, then as discussed above, they must be clearly labeled and identified so they can be properly compared to each other. </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Online Service Provider</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> In response to questions in the claim form, you indicate that the respondent is an online service provider (OSP) and that your infringement claim is based on its </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“storage of or referral or linking to infringing material posted by others,” but that you did not send </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">it </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">the “takedown notice” required by Section 512 of the Copyright Act.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">If your answers are correct, your claim cannot move forward,  because you can only bring an infringement claim against an OSP if it failed to take down third-party material in response to a takedown notice. <span style="position:absolute; border: gray 1px solid; left:0px; top:3418px; width:612px; height:792px;"></span>

5 </span><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size:12px"> </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Special rules apply to infringement claims brought against OSPs, which provide online services to store (and make available), refer to, provide access to, or link to material that is available online.  OSPs include content-sharing websites and internet search engines, among other services.  Section 512 of the Copyright Act provides what are </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">known as “safe harbors,” which shield certain OSPs from paying damages for copyright infringement claims if, </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">among other things, the OSP takes steps to quickly remove or disable access to infringing material when a copyright owner notifies them about the infringement through a proper takedown notice.  An infringement claim against an OSP that is eligible for a section 512 safe harbor must state facts that indicate that the respondent did not follow those procedures.  An infringement claim against an OSP eligible for a section 512 safe harbor cannot be compliant </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">unless you affirm that you sent the OSP a section 512 notice of infringement, and that it “failed to remove or </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">di</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">sable access to the material expeditiously upon the provision of such notice.”</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">  17 U.S.C. § 1506(f)(1)(C)(i); 37 C.F.R. § 222.2(c)(7)(iii)(G). Your infringement claim is not compliant because you affirm that it is based on the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">respondent’s actions as an </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">OSP, but that you did not send the OSP a proper takedown notice.  Your claim also does not include any facts that support your allegations that the respondent is an OSP notified about third-party material; instead, your allegations relate to its own use of allegedly infringing photographs.  Because you have not stated facts that suggest the respondent is an OSP, you may want to reconsider whether y</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">our answer should be “yes” to the question, “Are any of the respondents online service providers?” </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> Your infringement claim cannot proceed unless you file an amended claim that either (1) removes the allegation that the respondent is an OSP, or (2) alleges that it is an OSP that did not comply with a takedown notice you sent, and states facts in support of those allegations that would make it liable as an OSP, despite the Section 512 safe harbor.
