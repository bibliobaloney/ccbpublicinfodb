</span><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size:6px"> </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">2 The claim identifies Claimant Michelle Shocked (Shocked) as the author of the work.  The copyright registration identified in the claim, Registration No. PA0000575550, was issued to Polygram Music Publishing, Ltd. (Polygram) as the copyright claimant.  The Certificate of Registration also named Shocked as the sole author, but it does not identify Shocked as an owner of the copyright.  In another proceeding before the Board, </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Italic; font-size:12px">Michelle Shocked v. Gavin McInnes</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">, No. 22-CCB-0263, Shocked submitted supplemental documents that appeared to indicate that Polygram or its successor had reassigned to Shocked </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“all right, title and interest” in</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> multiple compositions, </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">including “Blackberry Blossom.”  Submitting </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">such documents in an amended claim in </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">this proceeding would clarify Shocked’s rights.</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> Registration No. PA0000575550 does not mention claimant Campfire Girl Publishing LLC (Campfire).  A supplemental document filed with the claim describes Campfire as the publishing company that administers the work, not a rights holder.  The claim does not present facts that indicate that Campfire has the right to bring a claim of infringement for the work as either a legal or beneficial owner.  To correct this issue, if you name Campfire as a claimant in an amended claim, you must include specific allegations about how it owns, or has an exclusive license to use, the exclusive rights at issue.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">You can do this either by adding facts to the “Describe the infringement” </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">section explaining </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Campfire’s </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">ownership of exclusive rights in the work at the time of the infringement, or by submitting supplemental documents on the Documentation page of the claim form that demonstrate </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Campfire’s </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">ownership.  Alternatively, you may file an amended claim that omits Campfire as a claimant. </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Infringing Activity</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> Your claim does not clearly state how the respondents used any exclusive rights you have in the allegedly infringed work without authorization.  Copyright law grants exclusive rights to copyright owners.  These include the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">right to reproduce, distribute, and publicly perform the work, and to make a “derivative work,” which is a work </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">based on the original work.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Someone who does one of those activities without the copyright owner’s permission </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">may be infringing the copyright, unless the use is otherwise authorized.  More information about exclusive rights is available on page 3 of the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Starting an Infringement Claim</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> chapter of the CCB Handbook. <span style="position:absolute; border: black 1px solid; left:157px; top:1397px; width:159px; height:0px;"></span>
</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">One form of authorization for certain uses of musical works is a “compulsory license” under 17 U.S.C. § 115.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Once a nondramatic </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">musical work has been publicly distributed in the United States under the copyright owner’s </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">authority, a person or entity that complies with the requirements of Section 115 of the Copyright Act may make and distribute digital phonorecord deliveries (DPDs) of that work.  A DPD is an individual digital transmission of a sound recording, for example, by downloads or streaming.  A DPD can be the basis of an infringement claim unless the sound recording copyright owner authorized it and (1) </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">it is also “authorized by the musical work copyright </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">owner, or by a record company pursuant to an individual download license</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">,” </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">or (2) the entity making the DPD obtained a compulsory license by complying with Section 115.  17 U.S.C. § 115(b)(2)(C)(i)(II).   Here, a </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">supplemental document</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> filed with the claim appears to be a copy of a </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“Notice of Intention to Obtain <span style="position:absolute; border: black 1px solid; left:90px; top:1579px; width:122px; height:0px;"></span>

It may serve the NOI on either the copyright owner or an agent of the copyright owner authorized to receive the NOI.  37 C.F.R. § 201.18(a)(6).   A </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">document uploaded with the claim, labeled as “Blackberry Blossom LANDR YouTube.docx,” appears to </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">include the contents of several emails related to the claim, which indicate that respondent The Harry Fox Agency </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">(Harry Fox) notified you of the NOI on November 21, 2023, and that Landr delivered DPDs of As the Crow Flies’ recording of “Blackberry Blossom”</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> to online outlets, including respondent YouTube, on November 24, 2023.  These documents indicate that the timing of the NOI was proper.   </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">The NOI also must “</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">comply, in form, content, and manner of service, with requirements that the Register of Copyrights shall prescribe by regulation</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">.”  17 U.S.C. § </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">115(b)(2)(A).  Those regulations are set forth at 37 C.F.R. § 201.18(d).  The form and content of the NOI filed with the claim seem to comply, and the claim does not appear to take issue with the manner of its service.  If you contend in an amended claim that the NOI does not comply, you must explain in detail how it did not comply.   Your claims against all respondents are based on the allegedly misattributed use and noncompliant NOI, so the claims cannot go forward unless you can state facts that show how Landr failed to comply with Section 115.  It is not sufficient to state the legal conclusion that the NOI was noncompliant without indicating what made it so.   In addition, even if you can </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">show in an amended claim that Landr’s use was not covered by a compulsory </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">license, you have not stated facts that provide a basis for a claim against any of the other three respondents.   </span><span style="font-family: SymbolMT; font-size:12px">•</span><span style="font-family: ArialMT; font-size:12px"> </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">It appears from the “Blackberry Blossom LANDR YouTube.docx” document that Harry Fox provided you notice of Landr’s NOI on November 21, 2023.
