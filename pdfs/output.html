</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Your claim does not include any details about where or how your work was available to the respondents before you allege the infringement began in 2021.  In your application for registration, you indicated that the original 2012 version of your work was published on your website and on YouTube, and that Ingram Spark published the 2023 version.  Your claim does not include those details, however, and it does not include specific allegations about </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">where or how the “revised and original text” covered by </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">the registration was available before the alleged infringement so that the respondents had an opportunity to see it.

Other than </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Blow’s 2015 reply, you have not shown that either respondent engaged with you on Twitter or anywhere else, </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">and you have not identified any content covered by your 2023 registration that appeared in any of your tweets.

To address this issue, you must file an amended claim with allegations that make access a reasonable possibility, not just hypothetically or theoretically possible.  Acceptable allegations of access may include that your registered work (a) was sent directly to a respondent or a close associate of a respondent; (b) was widely disseminated or was available to the public or respondents; or (c) is so strikingly similar to the respondents</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">’</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> work that they could not have created it independently. </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Substantial Similarity</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> Your claim also does not include enough facts that explain the similarities between your registered work and the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">respondent’s allegedly infringing work.</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">  The allegedly infringing work must be substantially similar to copyright-protected elements in the allegedly infringed work.  If it is not readily apparent from supplemental documents that are submitted with the claim, you must provide some specific allegations about how the allegedly infringing work is similar to expressive material in your work that copyright protects. A valid copyright only extends to copyrightable subject matter, and copyright law only protects the components of a work that are original to the author. Information about copyrightable authorship is available in Sections 302, 308, and 313 of </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Chapter 300</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> of the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Italic; font-size:12px">Compendium of U.S. Copyright Office Practices, Third Edition</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">. <span style="position:absolute; border: black 1px solid; left:111px; top:2421px; width:60px; height:0px;"></span>
Your allegations do not identify similarities that relate to copyrightable expression.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">You allege that Blow’s book </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:11px">reproduces “</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:11px">original ideas and concepts</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:11px">” from your work, and “</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:11px">incorporates elements and themes that closely </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">resemble those</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">” in your work, “including </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">discussions about Black American empowerment, predominant <span style="position:absolute; border: gray 1px solid; left:0px; top:2576px; width:612px; height:792px;"></span>

However, a valid copyright only extends to copyrightable subject matter, and copyright law does not protect ideas, concepts, or theories.  See Section 313.3(A) of the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Italic; font-size:12px">Compendium</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">.  It only protects original elements of expression.  Writing a book that advocates a political theory or strategy, for example, would not give the author the right to prevent others from exploring or advocating that theory or strategy in their own works.  Instead, what copyright may protect is the particular way that the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">author’s writings</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> express that theory or strategy or, in other words, the actual way in which the book is written.   </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">You also assert that there are “similarities </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">between [your] promotion of the Black Paper: Black American Homeland and Blow</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">’</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">s book content</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">.”</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">  However, your copyright registration does not appear to cover promotional materials such as YouTube or Twitter posts.  To support the element of substantial similarity, you must identify similarities between </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">the respondents’ work and protected elements that appear in </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">your work, not in promotional materials separate from the work itself. </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">The “Describe the work” section </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">of the claim provides a general description of a political strategy advocated in your book, but you have not provided information describing or showing the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“revised and original text” </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">covered by your registration</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">.

As a result, the claim does not provide enough information to enable the respondents to understand the claim and respond to it.  If you submit an amended claim, it must include allegations that support the element of substantial similarity.  Please provide more details and background regarding this element in your amended claim, including a clear, detailed statement regarding which elements of expression in your work were taken by the respondents in the allegedly infringing work, or copies or other documents that are sufficient to show the similarities.  If you include copies of the works at issue as supplemental documents, they must be clearly labeled and identified so they can be properly compared to each other.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Relief Requested</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> The Board is only authorized to grant certain kinds of relief.  Unlike a federal court, the Board cannot order respondents to stop or modify their </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">activities (sometimes called an “injunction”) unless the respondent</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> notifies the Board that, if found liable for infringement, they will stop or modify the activity.
