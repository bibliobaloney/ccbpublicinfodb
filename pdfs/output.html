As a </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">result, your claim presents unclear information about your status as a legal or beneficial owner of the allegedly infringed works.   </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">To bring a copyright infringement claim before the Board, the claimant must be “the legal or beneficial owner of the exclusive right [in a copyrighted work] at the time of the infringement.” </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> 17 U.S.C. § 1504(c)(1).  A legal owner is an author of the work who owns the exclusive rights at issue, or a person or entity that has received a transfer of those rights, for example, by an assignment or an exclusive license.  A beneficial owner is a legal owner who has transferred the rights at issue but retains some of the advantages of ownership, such as the right to receive royalties from the use of the work.  More information about legal and beneficial ownership is available at page 4 of the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Starting an Infringement Claim</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> chapter of the CCB Handbook.  A claimant who is not an author or named <span style="position:absolute; border: black 1px solid; left:53px; top:1202px; width:159px; height:0px;"></span>
copyright owner of the allegedly infringed work must provide some specific details or supplemental documents explaining how the claimant owns, or has an exclusive license to use, the exclusive rights at issue. </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">In the “Works infringed” section of </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">your claim, you list musical compositions titled </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“Canto a Borinquen” and “</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Vive tu vida contento</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">”</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> as the allegedly infringed works.

Exhibit 4 pp. 7-8, 14-21.   However, other documents filed with the claim appear to indicate that Rodriguez purported to assign the same rights to ACEMLA.  In a different document dated February 2, 1996, Rodriguez purported to transfer and assign to ACEMLA the right to license all forms of performance of each of his compositions.  Exhibit 4 pp. 5-6.

</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">document dated February 2, 1996, which appears to be a “rider” attached to the purported assignment to </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">ACEMLA, Rodriguez declared that, of the musical works being submitted to ACEMLA, none had been assigned to another organization, except those that may have been assigned to a publisher who had been duly informed.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Italic; font-size:12px">Id. </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">pp. 2-3.

Your label for Exhibit 2 indicates that it contains the documents recorded at V3401D915 on March 19, 1996.  However, Exhibit 2 appears to be incomplete, as a review of Copyright Office records indicates that the March 19, 1996 recordation included at least the first page of both the ACEMLA assignment and the rider that appear in full in Exhibit 4.  Both transfers seem to have been recorded at once, and it is not obvious which one may have priority.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Italic; font-size:12px">Cf.</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">17 U.S.C. § 205(d) (“As between two conflicting transfers, the one recorded first prevails if it is </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">recorded . . . at any time before recordation in such manner of the lat</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">er transfer.”).</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> These documents leave it unclear if LAMCO is a proper claimant in this proceeding.  They seem to indicate that LAMCO and ACEMLA are related entities with conflicting claims to ownership of the works in question.  It appears that Rodriguez purported to separately assign the public performance rights for both works to both entities at once.  Your claim does not explain the nature of the relationship between those entities, or indicate why LAMCO, rather than ACEMLA, has the right to bring a claim of infringement of the works in question.   To address this issue, you must file an amended claim with allegations that indicate how LAMCO is a legal or beneficial owner of the copyrights.  Alternatively, if LAMCO is not a legal or beneficial owner and ACEMLA is, then any amended claim must remove LAMCO as the claimant and name ACEMLA as the claimant instead.  If ACEMLA has a right to claim legal ownership of the works, it may be a necessary party, without which the claim may not proceed.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Italic; font-size:12px">See </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">17 U.S.C. § 1506(f)(3)(A).  In any event, your amended claim must clarify the relationship between the apparently conflicting 1996 transfers, and clarify what rights both LAMCO and ACEMLA have with respect to the works.   </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Access </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Your claim does not provide facts about how the respondent had access to the allegedly infringed compositions. </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“Access” </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">means a reasonable opportunity to hear the works before the alleged infringement took place.   You show that the two Ramos compositions were registered by the Copyright Office in 1974 and indicate that Rodriguez assigned the copyrights to LAMCO; and you seem to show that LAMCO issued a takedown notice for allegedly infringing videos with the same titles as the compositions.  However, you have not indicated how the respondent had access to the musical compositions before the videos were posted. To address this issue, you must file an amended claim with allegations that make access a reasonable possibility, </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:11px">not just hypothetically or theoretically possible.  Acceptable allegations of access may include that your works (a) </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">were sent directly to the respondent or a close associate of the respondent; (b) were widely disseminated or were <span style="position:absolute; border: gray 1px solid; left:0px; top:2576px; width:612px; height:792px;"></span>

Alternatively, you can upload copies of your works and the allegedly infringing works if they demonstrate that the works are so strikingly similar that they could not have been created independently.

If it is not readily apparent from supplemental documents that are submitted with the claim, you must provide some specific allegations about how your works and the allegedly infringing works are substantially similar. Your claim does not provide enough information describing or showing the allegedly infringing works.  Other </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">than providing their titles and author’s name, you indicate only that they are musical compositions that include </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">lyrics.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">No allegations in the “Describe the infringement” </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">section of the claim describe your works or the allegedly infringing works, or state or show how they are identical or substantially similar.  In addition, you have not provided a copy of your works or the allegedly infringing works as supplemental documents.  As a result, the claim does not provide enough information to enable the respondent to understand the claim and respond to it.   If you submit an amended claim, it must include more factual allegations that support the element of substantial similarity.  Please provide more details and background regarding this element in your amended claim, including a clear, detailed statement regarding which portions of your works were taken by the respondent in the allegedly infringing works, or documents that are sufficient to show the similarities.
