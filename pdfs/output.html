The claim cannot move forward unless it is properly </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">amended.  If you wish to proceed with this claim, you must file a second amended claim by </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">March 6, 2025</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">.  If you </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">do not, the Board must dismiss your claim without prejudice, although you may file again in the future before the Board or in federal court.  There is no additional filing fee for an amended claim.  If you file a second amended claim and it is found compliant, you will be notified and directed to proceed with service.  However, if your second amended claim also is found not to comply, the Board will dismiss the proceeding without prejudice.  17 U.S.C. § 1506(f)(1)(B); 37 C.F.R. § 224.1(d).   To make your second amended claim compliant, you must resolve the issues identified below.  37 C.F.R. § 224.1(c)(2).  You may also choose to correct or edit any errors or other information in your claim before you file it again.  You do not need to provide a legal argument in your claim </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">–</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> just a statement of facts and circumstances.

Those general assertions do not describe any activity that would amount to copyright infringement.  Copyright protection only extends to the specific creative expression in a work that is original to the author.  Information about copyrightable authorship is available in Sections 302, 308, and 313.4 of </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Chapter 300</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> of the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Italic; font-size:12px">Compendium of <span style="position:absolute; border: black 1px solid; left:396px; top:1340px; width:60px; height:0px;"></span>
U.S. Copyright Office Practices, Third Edition</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">.  Not all elements of a creative work are protected by copyright.  For example, copyright law does not protect ideas, concepts, facts, systems, or methods of operation.  It does not protect procedures, processes, or methods for doing, making, or building things.  Copyright can only protect the particular way that such things are expressed.  More information is available in </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Circular 33: Works Not Protected <span style="position:absolute; border: black 1px solid; left:402px; top:1421px; width:168px; height:0px;"></span>

Your TXu002463679 registration covers the text of a three-</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">page, written description of certain features of “an </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">AI-</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">powered family assistant.”  As a copyright owner, you have certain exclusive rights, including the right to reproduce and distribute your textual work, and to make a “derivative work” that is ba</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">sed on your textual work.  However, the registration is limited to the copyrightable, literary aspects of your work, because copyright law does not give you any exclusive rights in any idea, procedure, process, system, methods of operation, concept, principle, or discovery described in your work.  The copyright does not give you a right to prevent others from using the ideas, concepts, principles, or discoveries described in the work, or from implementing any procedures, processes, systems, or methods of operation described in the work.   </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:11px">Your allegations do not describe Amazon, for example, reproducing or distributing any expressive content in </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">your literary work, or creating a derivative work based on the expressive content in your work without permission.  <span style="position:absolute; border: gray 1px solid; left:0px; top:1734px; width:612px; height:792px;"></span>
<div style="position:absolute; top:1734px;"><a name="3">Page 3</a></div>
</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Instead, you allege that Amazon’s Alexa uses certain </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">ideas or processes described in your work, which would not be a copyright infringement.  If you file a second amended claim, it must include facts that describe acts infringing your copyright, specifying how the respondent engaged in the infringing activity. </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Access</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> As amended, your claim still does not provide facts that indicate how Amazon had access to your work.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“Access” means a reasonable opportunity to </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">see or copy your work before the alleged infringement took place.  You allege that the infringement began in March 2024, and that: </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Amazon had access to my work through internal means, as I had not publicly disclosed or published my work prior to Amazon</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">’</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">s announcements.</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">”  Nothing in the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">claim supports that assertion.  You do not state facts that make it plausible that Amazon accessed your undisclosed, unpublished work, or was even aware of your work, while it was developing updates or new versions of Alexa. In </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">addition, you do not explain what “internal means” the respondents could have used to access your work. </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> To address this issue, you must file an amended claim with allegations that make access a reasonable possibility, not just hypothetically or theoretically possible.  Acceptable allegations of access may include how your work (a) was sent directly to the respondent, or a close associate of the respondent; (b) was widely disseminated or available to the respondent; or (c) is so strikingly similar to the allegedly infringing works that the respondent could not have created them independently.   Alternatively, you could upload copies of your work and the allegedly infringing work(s) if they demonstrate that the expressive contents of the works are so strikingly similar that they could not have been created independently.  If you include copies of the works at issue as supplemental materials, they must be clearly labeled and identified so they can be properly compared to each other.   </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Substantial Similarity</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> As amended, your copyright infringement claim still does not include enough facts to indicate how any allegedly infringing work is substantially similar to original, expressive elements of your work that copyright protects.  In the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“Describe the infringement” section of the amended claim, you state:</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">The similarities between my work and Amazon</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">’</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">s Alexa updates are substantial and include: 1.</span><span style="font-family: ArialMT; font-size:12px"> </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">AI-powered personal assistant  2.</span><span style="font-family: ArialMT; font-size:12px"> </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Family-centric approach  3.</span><span style="font-family: ArialMT; font-size:12px"> </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Smart home automation. Your allegations do not identify substantial similarities that relate to copyrightable expression.  You do not present facts that indicate that Amazon uses any written text from your work.  As discussed above, copyright protection only extends to the specific creative expression in a work that is original to the author.  While it can protect the specific way your work expresses its description of an AI-powered family assistant, it does not prevent Amazon from creating or updating its own works without using your written text.  You do not clearly indicate how </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:11px">much written content of your work, if any, appeared in any allegedly infringing work.  As a result, your amended <span style="position:absolute; border: gray 1px solid; left:0px; top:2576px; width:612px; height:792px;"></span>
<div style="position:absolute; top:2576px;"><a name="4">Page 4</a></div>
</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">claim does not provide enough information for the Board to understand how any copyright-protected expression in the works is substantially similar.  If you submit a second amended claim, it must include more factual allegations that support the element of substantial similarity, including a clear, detailed statement regarding which portions of your work were used in an allegedly infringing work without authorization, or documents that are sufficient to show the similarities.  If you include copies of the works at issue as supplemental materials, then they must be attached to your amended claim and clearly labeled and identified so they can be properly compared to each other. </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Final Amendment</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> Your amended claim resolves some, but not all, of the compliance issues raised in the January 24, 2025 Order.
