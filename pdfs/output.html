Copyright law grants exclusive rights to copyright owners.  These include the right to reproduce, distribute, and publicly perform </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">the work, and to make a “derivative work,” which is a work based on the original work.</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">  Someone who does one of those activities without the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">copyright owner’s permission may be infringing the copyright, unless they h</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">ave a legitimate defense.

CCB Handbook. In your claim, </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">you provided “SR0001004568” as the registration number of the work.  This registration number </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">corresponds to the sound recording of the album </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“Up in the Sky…By Dan Frost</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">.</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">”</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">  You describe the infringement </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">as “[p]lagiarized content of lyrics and melody.”</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">  However, a Board search of Copyright Office records shows that the scope of your registration only covers the sound recording of each song included with the album, meaning it does not extend to any musical works embodied in the sound recordings.  When you record a song, you may be creating two works that are protected by copyright: a musical work and a sound recording.  A sound recording and the music, lyrics, words, or other content included in the recording are separate copyright-protected works.  These works are subject to different rules and are commonly owned and licensed separately.  A musical work </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">is a song’s </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">underlying composition along with any accompanying lyrics. A sound recording is a series of musical, spoken, or other sounds fixed in a recording medium, such as a CD or digital file.  If you file an amended copyright infringement claim, please include a more detailed description about how you claim your </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">sound recording</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> was used by the respondent, including what part of each song was used.  Information about those two different kinds of copyright works is available in </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Circular 56A: Copyright Registration of Musical Compositions and Sound <span style="position:absolute; border: black 1px solid; left:178px; top:1344px; width:373px; height:0px;"></span>

infringement of an underlying musical work(s), you would need to apply for copyright registration on that/those work(s) (to the extent you do not already have a registration applied for before you filed this claim) and then refile your claim as a new claim as you must have a copyright registration or pending application for registration on any work which you claim was infringed before filing a claim.  Additionally, the registration indicates that the respondent is the co-author and potentially co-owner of the work.  If two or more people contribute to a work, with the intention that their contributions will be merged into a </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">single work, they are considered “joint authors” of that work.</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">  Any of the owners of the copyright in a joint work can enforce the copyright or give permission to others to use their rights.  While there are potential types of claims that co-owners of a work could have against each other, copyright infringement is not one of them.  Therefore, claims between co-owners of a work are not suitable for the CCB.  See </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Chapter 500</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> of the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Italic; font-size:12px">Compendium of U.S. <span style="position:absolute; border: black 1px solid; left:367px; top:1567px; width:60px; height:0px;"></span>

clarify how the respondent used one of the exclusive rights in your sound recording without your permission and explain why he is not a co-owner of the work.  Y</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">our amended claim must include facts in the “Describe the infringement” section that (1) </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">specify how the respondent infringed your sound recording, (2) clarifies the ownership of the work, and (3) describe the allegedly infringing acts of the respondent.  You should be as detailed as possible, setting forth what the respondent did in relation to the songs from the album you allege were infringed.  If you maintain that the respondent infringed the music and lyrics of the album, you will need to provide a registration that covers the music authorship.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Substantial Similarity </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> Your claim also does not include enough facts that explain the similarities between your work and the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">respondent’s allegedly infringing work.</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">  If it is not readily apparent from supplemental documents that are submitted with the claim, you must provide some specific allegations about how your work and the allegedly infringing work are similar. Your claim states that your work is a sound recording.  However, you do not provide any information describing or depicting your work.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">No allegations in the “Describe the infringement” field of the claim describe </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">your work or the allegedly infringing work, or state or show how they are identical or substantially similar.  As described above, melody and lyrics are elements protected by a copyright in the musical composition; the scope of your registration only covers the sound recording of the album but does not extend to any musical works embodied in the sound recordings.  To bring a claim of copyright infringement of a sound recording, the allegedly infringing work must contain actual sounds recorded in the allegedly infringed sound recording.  If you maintain the allegations that the infringing activity is the creation of a derivative work based on your sound recording, your amended claim must allege facts that show that the respondent rearranged, remixed, or in other ways reproduced or altered the actual sounds embodied in your sound recording, because for sound recordings, the right to prepare derivative works is limited to such acts.  See 17 U.S.C. § 114(b) (the exclusive rights to make copies and derivative works of a sound recording </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“do not extend to the making or duplication of another sound recording that consists entirely of an independent </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">fixation of other sounds, even though such sounds imitate or simulate those in the copyrighted sound recording.</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">”</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">)  If you submit an amended claim, it must include more factual allegations that support the element of substantial similarity.  Please provide more details and background regarding this element in your amended claim, including a clear, detailed statement regarding which portions of your work were taken by the respondent in the allegedly infringing work, or documents that are sufficient to show the similarities.  If you include copies of the works at issue as supplemental documents, they must be clearly labeled and identified so they can be properly compared to each other.

In your claim, you state that the infringement starting May 20, 2020, and is ongoing.  As mentioned above, it appears that you and the respondent have a previous relationship spanning several years and it is unclear from the information provided in your claim when the infringement began, and you do not provide any information about when you discovered the alleged infringement.  Only allegedly infringing acts that that took place or that you should have reasonably discovered on or after May 17, 2022, three years before the day that you filed the claim with the Board, would fall within the statute of limitations period.
