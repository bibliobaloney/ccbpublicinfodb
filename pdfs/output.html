However, a Board search of Copyright Office records for that application found that the Copyright Office has not yet received a deposit copy of the allegedly infringed work. </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">The term “deposit” refers to </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">the copy or copies of a work that must be submitted to the Copyright Office with an application for registration.

If the deposit was not delivered to the Copyright Office before the claim was filed, the Board cannot hear the claim. To address this issue, if you file an amended claim, please include the registration number for the work or a service request number for an application to register the work.  Either the registration must have been issued, or the application, deposit, and fee must have been delivered to the Copyright Office, before you filed your original claim on August 26, 2024.  If you had not delivered a deposit of your work to accompany your application and fee at that time, this claim cannot be successfully amended and cannot proceed.  Instead, you would need to submit a deposit to support your pending application to register the copyright before you can refile your claim as a new claim.
