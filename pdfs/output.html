Your claim does not provide enough facts about three of these elements further detailed below.

Copyright law grants exclusive rights to copyright owners.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">These include the right to reproduce, distribute, and publicly perform the work, and to make a “derivative work,” </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">which is a work based on the original work.  Someone who does one of those activities without the copyright </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">owner’s permission may be infringing the copyright, unless they</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> have a legitimate defense.  More information about exclusive rights is available on page 3 of the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Starting an Infringement Claim</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> chapter of the CCB Handbook. <span style="position:absolute; border: black 1px solid; left:241px; top:1113px; width:159px; height:0px;"></span>
You have brought a claim alleging that multiple respondents infringed your work; however, the claim does not include enough information to provide a basis to hold each respondent liable for infringement.  In your claim, you </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">state that “</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">I also learned that Rainforest Films&#x27; founder, Will Packer and Clint Culpepper, the CEO of Screen Gems, had formed a partnership</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">” and “</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">I had an attorney contact Rainforest Films, Screen Gems, Beyonce Knowles, and other related entities, regarding the potential infringement of my copyrighted screenplay</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">.”  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Additionally, you have included several news articles and websites about the respondents. However, you have not included enough facts to show that </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">each</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> respondent personally copied, distributed, performed, or prepared derivative works based on your work, or participated in any such infringing activity.  If you submit an amended claim, you must more fully explain how each respondent infringed your allegedly infringed work.   </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">To address this issue, your amended claim must include facts in the “Describe the infringement” </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">section that describe the infringing acts of each respondent.  Specifically, you need to include more information than a mere article about the respondent.  You should be as detailed as possible, setting forth what each respondent did.  If you cannot state facts to support an infringement claim about against any named respondents, you must omit them in the amended claim </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Access </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Your claim does not provide facts about how each respondent had access to your work.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“Access” means a </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">reasonable opportunity to view or hear your work before the alleged infringement took place.  In your claim, you </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">state that “I submitted my screenplay synopsis to Rainforest Films in 2001, because I felt that it fit the narrative and brand that they were focused on producing.” </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> Additionally, you filed supplementary documentation with your claim that shows correspondence between yourself and Rainforest Films regarding the work.  However, you have not clearly detailed how </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">each</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> respondent had access to your work.  Not all parties need to have had access to your work, to the extent that they were involved in the infringement of the work with persons who did have access, but your claim must have facts that clearly link the respondents that did have access to the work and the other respondents. <span style="position:absolute; border: gray 1px solid; left:0px; top:1734px; width:612px; height:792px;"></span>
<div style="position:absolute; top:1734px;"><a name="3">Page 3</a></div>
To address this issue, you must file an amended claim with allegations that make access a reasonable possibility, not just hypothetically or theoretically possible.  Acceptable allegations of access may include how your work (a) was sent directly to the respondent or a close associate of the respondent; (b) was widely disseminated or was available </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">to the respondent; or (c) is so strikingly similar to the respondent’s </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">work that the respondent could not have created it independently.  Alternatively, you can upload copies of your work and the allegedly infringing work if they demonstrate that the works are so strikingly similar that they could not have been created independently.  If you include copies of the works at issue as supplemental documents, they must be clearly labeled and identified so they can be properly compared to each other. </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Substantial Similarity </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> Your claim also does not include enough facts that explain the similarities between your work and the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">respondent’s allegedly infringing work. </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> If it is not readily apparent from supplemental documents that are submitted with the claim, you must provide some specific allegations about how your work and the allegedly infringing work are similar. </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Your claim states that your work is a screenplay about “a young and successful African</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">-</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">American couple.”</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">  You have also included a copy of your work, a copy of Obsessed, and a supplementary document that includes a table of alleged similarities. In this </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">comparison document</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> you compare the Obsessed screenplay to your work.  <span style="position:absolute; border: black 1px solid; left:158px; top:2097px; width:113px; height:0px;"></span>
Specifically, you compare specific plot points and themes in your poems to specific words and themes in Obsessed.  However, the copyrightable expression you described in this document is too general for copyright protection.  Copyright does not protect ideas although it may protect the way ideas are expressed. None of the similarities that you identify in the claim appear to relate to similarities in copyrightable expression.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“G</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">eneral plot ideas are not protected by copyright law; they remain forever the c</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">ommon property of artistic mankind.”</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Italic; font-size:12px">Berkic v. Crichton</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">, 761 F.2d 1289, 1293 (9th Cir. 1985).   To determine whether two works are substantially similar, it is necessary to focus on similarities between the plot, themes, dialogue, mood, setting, pace, characters, and sequence of events in the two works.  A claimant must show similarities not </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">in “</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">the basic plot ideas for stories, but the actual concrete elements that make up the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">total sequence of events and the relationships between the major characters.” </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">You must describe or show similarities related to the major elements in the work that make up the total sequence of events and relationships between the characters.</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:9px">  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Italic; font-size:12px">Id</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">.    As a result, the claim still does not provide enough information to enable the respondent to understand the claim and respond to it.  You may upload a copy of the allegedly infringing works, along with copies of your work, to make it easier to compare the works and see any expressive similarities.  Please note that if you do file the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">respondents’ works with the second amended claim, you must add specific allegations identifying main points in </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">each example that are substantially similar and pointing the Board and respondents to those similarities within the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:11px">attachments so that the Board and respondents can easily compare the actual works to your descriptions.

Infringement Claim</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> chapter of the CCB Handbook. <span style="position:absolute; border: black 1px solid; left:36px; top:2643px; width:100px; height:0px;"></span>
</span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Statute of Limitations </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> In your claim you state that you were aware of the allegedly infringing work when the movie Obsessed was released in 2009.  This raises questions about whether the statute of limitations prevents the Board from considering </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">your infringement claim.  A “statute of limitations” is a time limit set by law for starting a claim.  The statute of limitations period for copyright claims, for both federal court and the Board, is three years after the claim “accrues.” </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">17 U.S.C. §§ 507(b) &amp; 1504(b)(1).  Under applicable current law, a claim accrues when the infringement occurs or, if the claimant was not aware of the infringement at the time it occurred, at the time when the claimant knows or reasonably should know that an infringement occurred.  In addition, you may not recover damages for acts of infringement that occurred more than three years before you filed your claim with the CCB unless you first knew and reasonably should have known about the infringements within the three years before you filed the claim.  Because it is clear from your claim that you had seen </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“Obsessed” in 2009 and concluded that it was strikinglyh </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">similar to your screenplay, you must include allegations showing acts of infringement within the past three years in order for your claim to move forward.  In your amended claim, describe what acts of infringement occurred within three years before you filed your claim with the CCB. </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Relief Over CCB Statutory Maximum </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> It appears that you are seeking a larger damages award than the CCB can grant for this type of claim.  If you </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">seek damages in an infringement claim, you can seek either (1) actual damages, and the respondent’s profits from </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">the infringement, or (2) statutory damages.  You can request both in your claim, but you will need to choose before the Board issues a final determination.  Actual damages are money damages awarded based on the proven harm or loss you suffered.  An example of actual damages may be the amount of lost sales revenue you experienced.  Statutory damages are money damages awarded to a successful claimant within a range set by law, without the need </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">to provide proof of the actual amount of harm or loss.   </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">In your claim you state a request for “$27,500 [in] statutory relief.”  The most that respondents can be ordered </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">to pay in damages (actual or statutory) in a CCB proceeding is $30,000.  17 U.S.C. § 1504(e)(1)(D).  However, the maximum amount of </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Italic; font-size:12px">statutory</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> damages available from the CCB is $15,000 for each work that was infringed (or $7,500 per work in instances where the copyright was registered both after the infringement started and not within </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">three months of your work’s first publication). 17 U.S.C. §§ </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">1504(e)(1)(A)(ii)(I)-(II).  Your reference to $27,500 in </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">statutory relief” could be construed as a request for $27,500 in statutory damages, which is over the maximum </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">award of statutory damages. You can cure that problem by referring simply to </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“$27,000 in damages.”</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">  You also seek </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">payment of an “initiation fee of $2,500 and … the required documentation/verification for me to become a current </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">membership into the Screenwriters Guild of America </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">–</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">West”; “the 24 writing credits earned for the option to use my screenplay”; and for your screenplay “to be named the original screenplay for the feature film, ‘Obsessed.’” <span style="position:absolute; border: gray 1px solid; left:0px; top:3418px; width:612px; height:792px;"></span>
<div style="position:absolute; top:3418px;"><a name="5">Page 5</a></div>
</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">However, if the Board rules in your favor, it cannot order the respondent to do anything other than to pay you your actual or statutory damages.
