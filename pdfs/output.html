The claim cannot move forward unless it is amended. </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">If you wish to proceed with this claim, you must file an amended claim by </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">January 15, 2025</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">.

</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Board must dismiss your claim without prejudice, although you may file again in the future before the Board or in federal court.  If you file an amended claim and it is found compliant, you will be notified and directed to proceed with service.  There is no additional filing fee for an amended claim.  17 U.S.C. § 1506(f)(1)(B). To make your amended claim compliant, you must resolve the issues identified below.  37 C.F.R. § 224.1(c)(2).  You may also choose to correct or edit any errors or other information in your claim before you file it again.  You do not need to provide a legal argument in your claim </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">–</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> just a statement of facts and circumstances.

To address this issue, you must file an amended claim with allegations that make access a reasonable possibility, not just hypothetically or theoretically possible.  Acceptable allegations of access may include how your work (a) was sent directly to the respondent or a close associate of the respondent; (b) was widely disseminated or was available to the respondent; or (c) is so strikingly </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">similar to the respondent’s </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">work that the respondent could not have created it independently.   Alternatively, you can upload copies of your work and the allegedly infringing work if they demonstrate that the works are so strikingly similar that they could not have been created independently.  If you include copies of the works at issue as supplemental documents, they must be clearly labeled and identified so they can be properly compared to each other. <span style="position:absolute; border: black 1px solid; left:320px; top:195px; width:240px; height:0px;"></span>

Your claim does not provide detailed information describing your work or the allegedly infringing work, or how they are identical or substantially similar.  For example, while you allege that the respondent </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">has copied or using a copy of my copyrighted material to sell ornaments with copyrighted story card attached</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">,” on “</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Etsy and possibly other online sites</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">,”</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> you do not indicate how much of your work appeared in any allegedly infringing item.  You also have not provided a copy of your work or any allegedly infringing work as supplemental documents.  As a result, the claim does not provide enough information to enable the respondent to understand the claim and respond to it.  When you submit an amended claim, it must include more factual allegations that support the element of substantial similarity.  Please provide more details and background regarding this element in your amended claim, including a clear, detailed statement regarding which portions of your work were taken by the respondent in the allegedly infringing work, or documents that are sufficient to show the similarities.  If you include copies of the works at issue as supplemental documents, they must be clearly labeled and identified so they can be properly compared to each other.
