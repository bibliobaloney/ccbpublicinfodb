acts committed specifically by the named respondent Lolcow LLC (Lolcow).  You allege infringement of a motion </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">picture or audiovisual work titled “College Truth 2 by Roy Philipose” that you describe as: “My video about college </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">advice</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">”</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> (</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“Work”)</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">  You allege that infringing acts occurred on the KiwiFarms website, where your Work was posted </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">by a KiwiFarms user with the username “ronic</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">,</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">”</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> after pressure from KiwiFarms owner Joshua Moon (username </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“Null”). </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">  However, your claim does not state or show how KiwiFarms or any named KiwiFarms user has any relationship with Lolcow.  No allegations describe Lolcow committing an infringing act, and you identify Joshua Moon, not </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Lolcow, as KiwiFarms’ owner</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">.  You mention Lolcow only in the section of the claim naming the respondent.  As a result, the claim does not make clear why Lolcow is a proper respondent.  If you file an amended claim, it must include facts that indicate how the named respondent Lolcow is responsible for the alleged infringement of your Work, including a description of any relationship between Lolcow and KiwiFarms. </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Infringing Activity</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> Your claim also does not show a basis for raising a claim against Lolcow, or anyone other than certain KiwiFarms users, for acts infringing your copyright.  Your allegations describe infringing activity by third parties, not listed as respondents to the claim, who used KiwiFarms to post your video.  By contrast, you do not describe any activity where Lolcow used your work in a way that would violate any of your exclusive rights as a copyright owner.  Contentions that third parties used the KiwiFarms website to commit infringement, without more, would not make Lolcow or Joshua Moon liable for infringement. Other allegations in your claim indicate that Joshua Moon, as </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">KiwiFarms’ </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">owner, cannot be liable for damages for the alleged third-party infringements because the website </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">complied with the “safe harbor” requirements in </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">section 512 of the Copyright Act.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Those “safe harbors” shield certain online service providers (“OSPs”) from </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">paying damages for copyright infringement claims if, among other things, they take steps to quickly remove or disable access to infringing material when a copyright owner notifies them about infringement through a proper takedown notice.  In this context, an OSP is a provider of online service to store (and make available), refer to, provide access to, or link to material that is available online.  OSPs include content-sharing websites and internet search engines, among other services.  An infringement claim against an OSP eligible for a section 512 safe harbor cannot be compliant unless you affirm that you sent the OSP a section 512 notice of infringement, and that it </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“failed to remove</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> or disable access to the material expeditiously </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">upon the provision of such notice.”</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">  17 U.S.C. § 1506(f)(1)(C)(i), 37 C.F.R. § 222.2(c)(7)(iii)(G).  Your claim does not indicate that you have sent anyone a takedown notice related to your Work posted on KiwiFarms. You describe your Work </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">as a “10 hour long file” that you posted on YouTube in 2014</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">, and you allege that Joshua Moon pressured ronic to repost your Work on KiwiFarms in 2019.  However, your claim appears to be based on a later incident, as you allege that the infringement at issue began on October 16, 2023.  Another </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:11px">document filed with the claim </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:11px">labeled “</span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:11px">copy1.png</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:11px">” </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:11px">appears to show a KiwiFarms post, dated October 16, 2023, in <span style="position:absolute; border: black 1px solid; left:218px; top:1619px; width:51px; height:0px;"></span>
</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">which ronic posted more than twenty video clips, stating, “Managed to get it uploaded in 30</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">-</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">minute segments.”  <span style="position:absolute; border: gray 1px solid; left:0px; top:1734px; width:612px; height:792px;"></span>
<div style="position:absolute; top:1734px;"><a name="3">Page 3</a></div>
</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">You have not named ronic or Joshua Moon as a respondent, however, and it is not apparent from the claim how Lolcow or Joshua Moon caused or was given notice of any infringing act on or after October 16, 2023.  Without more, when a third-party user posts infringing content on a website, the website host is not liable for damages for infringement. If you file an amended infringement claim, you must include clear allegations that describe what the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">respondent’s</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> infringing acts were, such as copying, distributing, or performing your work.  To proceed against an OSP, your amended claim must describe how it actually engaged in infringing activities, or state facts supporting allegations that would make it liable as an OSP, despite the Section 512 safe harbors, because it failed to expeditiously remove or disable access to the infringing material after you sent a takedown notice to the OSP.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Other Filings</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> After </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">filing the claim, you also filed documents labeled “Revision” (Dkt. 2), “Addendum to Relief Sought” (Dkt. 3), and “Addendum and Correction” (Dkt. 4).  These subsequent filings are not </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">considered part of the claim and did not serve to amend the claim.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Italic; font-size:12px">See</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> Dkt. 5.  You may choose to include matters stated in those filings in an amended claim; however, even if those matters had been included in the claim, it would not have affected the noncompliance issues discussed above.  For future reference, information about requesting permission to amend a claim during the compliance review stage is available in the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Other Issues in Proceedings</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> chapter of the CCB Handbook. <span style="position:absolute; border: black 1px solid; left:233px; top:2097px; width:143px; height:0px;"></span>
</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">In addition, the “Addendum to Relief Sought” </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">appears to raise requests for relief from third parties, for </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">instance: “</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Prevent further copyright abuse </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Italic; font-size:12px">by others</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">” and “</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Removal of any archived content hosted </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Italic; font-size:12px">on other sites</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">”</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> (emphasis added).  The Board cannot grant any relief from non-parties, so you should not include such requests in an amended claim.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Even in a claim against KiwiFarms’ OSP or owner, th</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">e Board could not order them to remove any content from the site unless they notified the Board that they would remove the content if found liable for infringement.  (Respondents may decide to agree to stop or modify their infringing activity because, if they are found liable, the Board may consider that agreement when it decides how much to award as damages.)  Information about the forms of relief that the Board can grant is available in the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Damages</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> chapter of the CCB Handbook. <span style="position:absolute; border: black 1px solid; left:351px; top:2259px; width:48px; height:0px;"></span>
