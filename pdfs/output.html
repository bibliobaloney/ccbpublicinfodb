1.</span><span style="font-family: ArialMT; font-size:12px"> </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">You own a valid copyright in the work, or have been given an exclusive license to the copyright rights at issue in the work, 2.</span><span style="font-family: ArialMT; font-size:12px"> </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">The respondent used one of your exclusive rights in the work without permission, 3.</span><span style="font-family: ArialMT; font-size:12px"> </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">The respondent had access to your work, and 4.</span><span style="font-family: ArialMT; font-size:12px"> </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">The respondent’s work is substantially similar to the original elements of expression in your work.</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> Your claim does not provide enough clear facts to support the elements related to each respondent</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">’</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">s allegedly infringing activity and the substantial similarity of the works, as described below.  If you file a second amended claim, it must include enough details about the elements for the Board and the respondent to understand the facts </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">of the alleged infringement. </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Infringing Activity</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> Your amended claim still does not present enough facts to clearly state how each respondent engaged in any infringing activity.  As the December 20, 2023 Order stated: Copyright law grants exclusive rights to copyright owners.  These include the right to reproduce, distribute, and publicly perform </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">the work, and to make a “derivative work,” which is a work based on the original work.  Someone who does one of those activities without the copyright owner’s permission may be </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">infringing the copyright, unless they have a legitimate defense.  More information about exclusive rights is available on page 3 of the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Starting an Infringement Claim</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> chapter of the CCB Handbook. <span style="position:absolute; border: black 1px solid; left:175px; top:1583px; width:159px; height:0px;"></span>
Your allegations do not provide enough information or clarity about the infringing acts committed by each respondent.  Your claim does not clearly describe how each respondent played a role in any </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">infringement.  You allege that each respondent uploaded the work to an unspecified location: “</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">City Girls from QualityControlMusic llc Doja Cat, and Southside on the Track uploaded PussyTalk on July 3, 2020</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">.”  <span style="position:absolute; border: gray 1px solid; left:0px; top:1734px; width:612px; height:792px;"></span>

Luellen.)  While supplemental documents filed with the claim indicate that an allegedly infringing video was uploaded to YouTube, and all four respondents may have participated in making or distributing the allegedly infringing work, it is not plausible that each of the respondents uploaded the work together.  You also allege that respondent QualityControlMusic llc has signed artists from Memphis, where you live, and that you have </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“seen </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">City Girls</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">[’]</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">version of my song.”  Those allegations do not </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">offer enough detail about how each respondent used your work in a way that would infringe any exclusive rights.  Your claim does not discuss the respondents</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">’</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> allegedly infringing activities in enough detail to be clearly understood. You allege that the City Girls (Jatavia Johnson and Caresha Brownlee</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">) have a “version of my song,” and your amended claim adds the following allegation: “</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">I had a song already under copyright titled PussyTalk and the CityGirls ft Doja Cat song PussyTalk infringed on my work as a artist and creator</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">.”  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">However, your allegations still do not clearly describe where or how their allegedly infringing version was distributed or performed, or how the other respondents were involved in any infringing acts related to that version. If you submit a second amended claim, it must more fully explain how each respondent infringed your allegedly infringed work.  As the December 20, 2023 Order stated: </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">To address this issue, your amended claim must include facts in the “Describe the infringement” section </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">that describe acts infringing your copyrights, specifying how each respondent engaged in the infringing activity.  Include allegations that indicate how each respondent copied, distributed, performed, or prepared derivative works based on your allegedly infringed works, or participated in any such infringing activity.  You should be as detailed as possible, setting forth what each respondent did in relation to the work you allege was infringed. If you submit a second amended claim that does not clearly describe infringing acts by each respondent, it will be dismissed. </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Substantial Similarity</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> Your amended claim also does not include enough facts that explain the similarities between your work and the allegedly infringing work.  If it is not readily apparent from supplemental documents that are submitted with the claim, you must provide some specific allegations about how your work and the allegedly infringing work are </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">similar.  As the December 20, 2023 Order stated: </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">You allege</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">: “</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">When I first seen the City Girls version of my song I was traumatized and under emotional distress because it was too close for me to say it was unintentionally.</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">”  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Your allegations do not describe your work or the allegedly infringing work, or state or show how they are identical or substantially similar.  In addition, you have not provided a copy of your work or the allegedly infringing work as supplemental documents.  As a result, the claim does not provide enough information to enable the respondents to understand the claim and respond to it.   In addition, to bring a claim of copyright infringement of a sound recording, the allegedly infringing work must contain actual sounds recorded in the allegedly infringed sound recording.  Your allegations do </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">not describe how much of your work or which elements of your work are used in the allegedly infringing </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">work.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">For example, it is not clear whether you are alleging that the City Girls’ version of your song is a </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">cover version, or whether it samples your recording.   If you maintain that the infringing activity is the creation of a derivative work based on your sound recording, your second amended claim must allege facts that show that the respondent</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">s’ work</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> rearranged, remixed, or in other <span style="position:absolute; border: gray 1px solid; left:0px; top:2576px; width:612px; height:792px;"></span>
<div style="position:absolute; top:2576px;"><a name="4">Page 4</a></div>
ways reproduced and altered the actual sounds embodied in your sound recording, because for sound recordings, the right to prepare derivative works is limited to such acts.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">The owner of a sound recording copyright “is limited to claiming that [an alleged infringer] sampled or otherwise directly copied his recording.” </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Italic; font-size:12px">Greene v.

Please include a clear, detailed statement regarding which portions of your work were taken by the respondents in the allegedly infringing work, or documents that are sufficient to show the similarities.  If you include copies of the works at issue as supplemental documents, they must be clearly labeled and identified so they can be properly compared to each other.   </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Misrepresentation </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">–</span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px"> Elements </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> You are also bringing a claim of misrepresentation in connection with a takedown notice or counter-notice under 17 U.S.C. § 512(f).

Your amended claim still does not include enough allegations to support your misrepresentation claim.  You have not identified or described any misrepresentation that any respondent made to an OSP in connection with a takedown notice or counter-notice related to online materials or activity.  Instead, you allege that you sent a takedown notice to YouTube; that YouTube sent (and received) a counter-notice; and that YouTube stated that </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">my claim was being denied or dismissed</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">” and “</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">that I didn</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">’</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">t have enough information to proceed</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">.”  Those </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">allegations do not identify any false statement that a </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Italic; font-size:12px">respondent</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> made to an OSP.

As the December 20, 2023 Order stated: To support your claim of misrepresentation, you must provide additional facts to show that the counter-notice was sent by a respondent, and included a statement of fact that asserted </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“that material or activity was removed by mistake or misidentification,”</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> and you must show or explain why that statement was false or incorrect.   </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">If you submit an amended claim, you must state facts in support of each element of the claim, including </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">allegations that describe a false or incorrect statement of fact by a respondent that would violate section 512(f), indicating what words were false or incorrect and how they were false or incorrect.
