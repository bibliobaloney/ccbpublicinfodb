</span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Legal or Beneficial Ownership</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> Your claim does not present facts that indicate that the named claimants are both proper claimants because it is not clear that each claimant is a legal or beneficial owner of the allegedly infringed works.   </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">To bring a copyright infringement claim before the Board, the claimant must be “the legal or beneficial owner of the exclusive right [in a copyrighted work] at the time of the infringement.”</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">  17 U.S.C. § 1504(c)(1).  A legal owner is an author of the work who owns the exclusive rights at issue or a person or entity that has received a transfer of those rights, for example, by an assignment or an exclusive license.  A beneficial owner is a legal owner who has transferred the rights at issue but retains some of the advantages of ownership, such as the right to receive royalties from the use of the work.  More information about legal and beneficial ownership is available at page 4 of the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Starting an Infringement Claim</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> chapter of the CCB Handbook.  A claimant who is not an author or named <span style="position:absolute; border: black 1px solid; left:53px; top:1121px; width:159px; height:0px;"></span>
copyright owner of the allegedly infringed work must provide some specific details or supplemental documents explaining how the claimant owns, or has an exclusive license to use, the exclusive rights at issue.  Your claim lists two claimants, IVILIIA MILLIONIC IT Sp. z o.o. </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">(“Iviliia”) and </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Serhii Osadchyi </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">(“</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Osadchyi</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">”).  In the “Works infringed” section, you identify </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">claimant Osadchyi as the author of the four allegedly infringed works.  Copyright Office registration records for the works, filed as supplemental documents with the claim also identify Osadchyi as the author of each work, and indicate that ownership was transferred to Iviliia by written agreement.  Those records indicate that Iviliia is a legal owner of the copyrights, but that Osadchyi</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">’s rights</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> may have been transferred to Iviliia.  The claim does not present clear facts that indicate that Osadchyi has the right to bring a claim of infringement for the work as either a legal or beneficial owner. To correct this issue, your amended claim must include specific allegations about how each claimant owns, or has an exclusive license to use, the exclusive rights at issue.  You can do this either by </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">adding facts to the “Describe the infringement” section explaining how </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">both claimants were the owner of exclusive rights in the works at the time of the infringement or by submitting supplemental documents.  That may include explaining the relationship between the claimants: for example, Osadchyi could be considered a beneficial owner of the works if Osadchyi retains certain rights in each of the four works, including the rights to receive royalties.  In the alternative, if the information in the claim identifying the claimant or the author of the works is inaccurate, you may correct that information in an amended claim.   </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Infringing Activity</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> Your claim does not present enough facts to clearly state how the named respondent, Ilia Mazur </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">(“</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Mazur</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">”)</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">, used any exclusive rights you have in the allegedly infringed work without permission.   Copyright law grants exclusive rights to copyright owners.  These include the right to reproduce, distribute, and </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">publicly display the work, and to make a “derivative work,” which is a work based on the original work.  Someone </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">who does one of those activit</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">ies without the copyright owner’s permission may be infringing the copyright, unless </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:11px">they have a legitimate defense.  More information about exclusive rights is available on page 3 of the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:11px">Starting an <span style="position:absolute; border: black 1px solid; left:504px; top:1619px; width:55px; height:0px;"></span>

Your claim does not provide enough facts about infringing activity by the respondent.  The </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“Where the alleged infringing acts occurred” section of </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">the claim alleges infringing activity </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">on an “app on google play.”  The “Describe the infringement” section accuses Mazur of “[u]</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">sing our 4 (four) copyrighted characters without our authorisation.</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">”  The “</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Description of harm suffered and relief sought</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">” section accuses “[t]his developer” (presumably Mazur) of “[s]</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">elling a paid subscription in their app that utilises the above 4 characters.</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">”  Those allegations do not sufficiently </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">describe the extent of the allegedly infringing use of each character. To address this issue in an amended claim, please provide more details and background regarding </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Mazur’s</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> allegedly infringing activity.  I</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">nclude facts in the “Describe the infringement” section that describe acts infringing </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">your copyrights, specifying how the respondent engaged in the infringing activity.  You should be as detailed as possible, setting forth what the respondent did in relation to the works you allege were infringed.  For example, if you contend that the works were used in an app, you should describe how they were used, or show the extent of the use in supplemental documents.  Your description should make clear how your actual creative expression was copied and not merely an idea, as ideas are not protectible under copyright law. </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Access</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> Your claim does not provide facts about how the respondent had access to your works</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">.  “Access” means a </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">reasonable opportunity to view your works before the alleged infringement took place.   To address this issue, you must file an amended claim with allegations that make access a reasonable possibility, not just hypothetically or theoretically possible.  Acceptable allegations of access may include that your works (a) were sent directly to the respondent or a close associate of the respondent; (b) were widely disseminated or were available to the public or respondent; or (c) are </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">so strikingly similar to the respondent’s work</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">s that they could not have been created independently. Alternatively, you can upload copies of your works and the allegedly infringing works if those images demonstrate that the works are so strikingly similar that they could not have been created independently.  If you include copies of the works at issue as supplemental documents, they must be clearly labeled and identified so they can be properly compared to each other.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Substantial Similarity</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> Your claim also does not include enough facts that explain the similarities between your works and the allegedly infringing work.  If it is not readily apparent from supplemental documents that are submitted with the claim, you must provide some specific allegations about how your works and the allegedly infringing work are similar. You allege that the respondent used four copyrighted characters in an app, but you do not describe how much of your works were used, or how they appeared within the app.  Your allegations do not describe the allegedly infringing app, or state or show how it appears identical or substantially similar to your works.  In addition, you have not provided a copy of your works, or images from the allegedly infringing app, as supplemental documents.  As a result, the claim does not provide enough information to enable the respondent to understand the claim and <span style="position:absolute; border: gray 1px solid; left:0px; top:2576px; width:612px; height:792px;"></span>
<div style="position:absolute; top:2576px;"><a name="4">Page 4</a></div>
respond to it.   If you submit an amended claim, it must include factual allegations that support the element of substantial similarity.  Please include a clear, detailed statement regarding which portions of your works were taken by the respondent in the allegedly infringing work, or documents that are sufficient to show the similarities.  As mentioned above, if you include copies of the works at issue as supplemental documents, they must be clearly labeled and identified so they can be properly compared to each other.
