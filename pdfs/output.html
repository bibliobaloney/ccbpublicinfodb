To bring a copyright infringement claim </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">before the Board, the claimant must be “the legal or beneficial owner of the exclusive right [in a copyrighted work] at the time of the infringement.”</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">  17 U.S.C. § 1504(c)(1).  A legal owner is an author of the work who owns the exclusive rights at issue or a person or entity that has received a transfer of those rights, for example, by an assignment or an exclusive license.  A beneficial owner is a legal owner who has transferred the rights at issue but retains some of the advantages of ownership, such as the right to receive royalties from the use of the work.  A claimant who is not an author or named copyright owner of the allegedly infringed work must provide some specific details or supplemental documents explaining how the claimant owns, or has an exclusive license to use, the exclusive rights at issue.  The claim states that the author of the work is Chesley K. Nelson, who is not named as a claimant.  There is nothing alleged in the claim to indicate that Hollis L. Nelson is a proper claimant.  However, copyright office records state that Hollis Nelson is </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">listed as the “copyright claimant” on the registration for the work by means of a </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">written transfer agreement.  While Hollis Nelson will need to show that she is properly listed on the registration, that information is enough to allow Hollis Nelson to be a claimant at this stage of the proceeding. However, the claim does not present facts to indicate that Laverne L. Nelson is a proper claimant and Laverne Nelson is not listed on the copyright registration for the work.  As mentioned above, a claimant who is not an author or named copyright owner of the allegedly infringed work must provide some specific details or supplemental documents explaining how the claimant owns, or has an exclusive license to use, the exclusive rights at issue.  To correct this issue, your amended claim must include specific allegations about how the claimant owns, or has an exclusive license to use, the exclusive rights at issue.  You can do this either by adding facts to the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“Describe the infringement” section explaining how the claimant was the owner of exclusive rights in the work at </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">the time of the infringement or by submitting supplemental documents.   For example, you may describe the relationship between Chelsey K. Nelson or Hollis Nelson and Laverne Nelson in relation to the work) or detail how the claimant obtained legal or beneficial ownership of copyright.  If the information in the claim identifying the claimant or the authors of the work is inaccurate, you may correct that information in an amended claim.

You have brought a claim alleging that multiple respondents infringed your work; however, the claim does not include enough information to provide a basis to hold each respondent liable for infringement.  In your claim, you </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">state that “</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">I have seen my books and e-book posted on online marketplace websites, and on Amazon&#x27;s website by my books and e-book&#x27;s product profile, Ingram&#x27;s name posted on websites by my property and on 20 other USA marketplace websites.</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">” and “</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">[o]ther websites I saw my property on will be in the documentations with images</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">.”  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">However, you have not included enough facts in the body of the claim to show that </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">each</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> respondent personally copied, distributed, performed, or prepared derivative works based on your work, or participated in any such infringing activity.  If you submit an amended claim, you must more fully explain how each respondent infringed your allegedly infringed work.   </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">To address this issue, your amended claim must include facts in the “Describe the infringement” </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">section that describe the infringing acts of each respondent.  Specifically, you need to include more information </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">than a screenshot of each respondent’s website.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">You should be as detailed as possible, setting forth what each respondent did and how each respondent acted together to infringe your work.  If you cannot state facts to support an infringement claim about against any named respondents, you must omit them in the amended claim.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Access  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Your claim does not provide facts about how each respondent had access to your work.  “Access” means a </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">reasonable opportunity to view or hear your work before the alleged infringement took place.  In your claim, you </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">state that “print ready files were up</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">-loaded to Create Space printers of Amazon in 2016 by my bookmaker Will </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:11px">Roberson.”  However, you have not </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:11px">clearly detailed </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:11px">what it means to upload a document to “printers” or </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:11px">how </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:11px">each</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:11px"> </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">respondent had access to your work.

were involved in the infringement of the work with persons who did have access, but your claim must have facts that clearly link the respondents that did have access to the work and the other respondents. To address this issue, you must file an amended claim with allegations that make access a reasonable possibility, not just hypothetically or theoretically possible.  Acceptable allegations of access may include how your work (a) was sent directly to the respondent or a close associate of the respondent; (b) was widely disseminated or was available </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">to the respondent; or (c) is so strikingly similar to the respondent’s work that the respondent could not have created </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">it independently.  Alternatively, you can upload copies of your work and the allegedly infringing work if they demonstrate that the works are so strikingly similar that they could not have been created independently</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">—</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">however, this must still show access as described above related to the respondents in your claim.  If you include copies of the works at issue as supplemental documents, they must be clearly labeled and identified so they can be properly compared to each other. </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Substantial Similarity  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Your claim also does not include enough facts that explain the similarities between your work and the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">respondent’s allegedly infringing work.</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">  If it is not readily apparent from supplemental documents that are submitted with the claim, you must provide some specific allegations about how your work and the allegedly infringing work are similar. Your claim states that your work is </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">an illustrated children’s book.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">However, you do not provide enough </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">information describing or showing your work.  No allegations in the “Describe the infringement” field of the claim </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">describe the allegedly infringing works, or state or show how they are identical or substantially similar.  As noted below, due to the volume of supplementary documents included with the claim it is unclear if you have uploaded your work or the allegedly infringing works as supplementary documents.  As a result, the claim does not provide enough information to enable the respondent to understand the claim and respond to it.  If you submit an amended claim, it must include more factual allegations that support the element of substantial similarity.  Please provide more details and background regarding this element in your amended claim, including a clear, detailed statement regarding which portions of your work were taken by the respondent in the allegedly infringing work, or documents that are sufficient to show the similarities.  If you include copies of the works at issue as supplemental documents, they must be clearly labeled and identified so they can be properly compared to each other.  However, you should only upload the documents necessary as the Board and the respondent cannot be expected to go through dozens of attachments to find the relevant information.
