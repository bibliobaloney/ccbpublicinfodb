videos, and that use of those videos after the violation constituted infringement.  Supplemental documents filed with the claim include what appears to be a Production Agreement setting forth terms by which you were to produce a series of episodes for respondent Justin Schilleman a/k/a Justin Ross of Hogworkz.  However, the claim does not make clear that the parties ever signed the Production Agreement or otherwise agreed to its terms.   In addition, it is not clear that the alleged violations of the agreement would have made further use of the videos </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">infringing.  Your allegations suggest that the videos depict Hogworkz and were specifically created for Hogworkz’s </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">use, but that Hogworkz breached the agreement by ceasing production after four episodes, though more episodes were originally envisioned.  Those allegations appear to describe a breach of contract dispute, not a copyright infringement.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">A “breach of contract” is a violation of any of the agreed</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">-upon terms and conditions of a binding contract.  When a party to a contract does not fulfill an obligation stated in the contract, such as payment, it is typically considered a breach of contract.  The Board is authorized to hear copyright infringement claims but it is not authorized to hear claims for breach of contract. The Board may only hear infringement claims against a licensee of a work if the claim is based on a licensee </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">failing to satisfy a “condition precedent” of a license from the copyright owner, or if the licensee’s use of the work </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">went beyond the scope of the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">uses permitted under the license.  A “condition precedent” is an act or event that </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">must occur to trigger certain contract obligations.  For example, if an author agrees that a licensee may publish her </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">book “if, and only as long as” the licensee makes mont</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">hly payments to the author, then the payments may be a </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“condition precedent” to the licensee’s right to publish. </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> If a copyright license depends on the licensee first satisfying a condition precedent, and the licensee does not satisfy it before using the work, then the license is not effective and the licensor may raise a copyright infringement claim. If you can state facts that identify such a condition precedent included in your written or oral agreement with Hogworkz, or that the respondents used your work beyond what was permitted by your agreement, the Board may be able to hear your claim.  If you submit an amended claim, it must include allegations that state or show that any agreement with Hogworkz required it to satisfy a condition precedent, and that it did not satisfy that condition, or how the respondents used your work beyond what was permitted by your agreement.  Please provide more details and background regarding your agreement with Hogworkz, indicating whether the Production Agreement was signed, and including a clear, detailed statement regarding any conditions precedent included in that agreement.  In addition, if the respondents engaged in reproduction, distribution, or public displays of your work or adapted the work in ways that went beyond the scope of the uses permitted under your agreement, you should describe those uses and explain why they were beyond the scope of your agreement.  You should be as detailed as possible, specifying what each respondent did in relation to each work that you allege that the respondent infringed.  In addition, your amended claim should clearly identify how much material from each episode was infringed. Please review </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Circular 1: Copyright Basics </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">and the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Introduction</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> chapter in the CCB Handbook for more <span style="position:absolute; border: black 1px solid; left:119px; top:1587px; width:144px; height:0px;"></span>

In the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“Describe the infringement” section of the claim, you assert that “</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Hogworkz has shared the material with Grip FX to promote their products, which was no[t] agreed upon</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">,” </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">and you appear to indicate that respondents Grip FX LLC and KJet LLC both used some of the videos in online ads, but you do not describe how their acts relate to any acts by each other or by the other named respondents.  To address this issue, your amended claim must either be raised against only one respondent (or set of respondents, if you allege that they acted together in the same course of conduct), or must include facts that indicate that the respondents jointly engaged in the same allegedly infringing activities or were parts of a chain of one continuous course of infringing activities.  As discussed above, your amended claim must also identify each respondent</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">’</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">s allegedly infringing activities and describe how each respondent engaged in those activities. In addition, you provide the same mailing address for Grip FX LLC as for respondent Kyle Rowe, and the same mailing address for KJet LLC as for Justin Ross, which suggests that the LLC respondents may be related to the individual respondents, but you do not indicate what those relationships are.  If you file an amended claim, include further allegations that describe the relationships between the parties, and indicate why any respondent</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">’s activities</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> would not be within the scope of the allegedly violated agreement. </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Relief Requested</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">The “Description of harm suffered and relief sought” section of the claim indicates that you are seeking forms </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">of relief that are not typically available in a claim before the Board.
