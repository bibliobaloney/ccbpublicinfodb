The claim cannot move forward unless it is amended. </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">If you wish to proceed with this claim, you must file a second amended claim by </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">June 12, 2024</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">.  If you do not, <span style="position:absolute; border: black 1px solid; left:429px; top:334px; width:65px; height:0px;"></span>
</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">the Board must dismiss your claim without prejudice, although you may file again in the future before the Board or in federal court.  There is no additional filing fee for an amended claim.  If you file a second amended claim and it is found compliant, you will be notified and directed to proceed with service.  However, if your second amended claim also is found not to comply, the Board will dismiss the proceeding without prejudice.  17 U.S.C. § 1506(f)(1)(B); 37 C.F.R. § 224.1(d).   To make your second amended claim compliant, you must resolve the issues identified below.  37 C.F.R. § 224.1(c)(2).  You may also choose to correct or edit any errors or other information in your claim before you file it again.  You do not need to provide a legal argument in your claim </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">–</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> just a statement of facts and circumstances.  Being specific in your description gives the other party and the Board more information about your claim.

You allege that the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">respondents’ movie “Caroltyn” infringes your screenplay “Sister.”  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Your amended claim does not sufficiently describe anywhere that your screenplay has been accessible.  As stated in the April 23, 2024 noncompliance order: To address this issue, you must add allegations that make access by each respondent a reasonable possibility, not just hypothetically or theoretically possible.  Acceptable allegations of access may include how your work (a) was sent directly to the respondents or a close associate of the respondents; (b) was widely disseminated or was available to those respondents; or (c) is so strikingly similar to the respondents</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">’</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> work that they could not have been created independently.   In the amended claim, you assert </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">that “‘</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Caroltyn</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">’ </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">(2022) is so strikingly similar to my work </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">‘</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Sister</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">’ </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">(2018) that the works could not have been created independently.</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">”  You do not provide sufficient facts to support that bare </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">assertion.

</span><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size:12px"> </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">creation, coincidence, or prior common source are precluded, for example, when the works are virtually identical.  You have not described or shown such striking similarity.  Your allegation that </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“[i]</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">t may be possible that the defendants retrieved my screenplay from websites which provide the PDF versions of screenplays</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">” is speculative</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> and not specific.  Without more specifics, the Board cannot find that it is reasonably likely that the respondents had access to your work.   If you file a second amended claim, you must include more details about how your work was distributed, disseminated, or available to the respondents.  Alternatively, you may upload copies of your work and the allegedly infringing work, if they demonstrate that the works are so strikingly similar that they could not have been created independently.   </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Substantial Similarity</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> As amended, your claim still does not include enough facts that explain or show how your work and the allegedly infringing work are substantially similar, and you have not provided copies of the works as supplemental documents.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">In the “Describe the infringement” section, you include a request for an extension of time to amend the claim until June 23, 2024, to allow more time to procure a deposit copy of the respondents’ work from the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Copyright Office.  The Board cannot grant the request because the 30-day period for filing an amended claim is fixed by statute and the Board cannot extend it. 17 U.S.C. § 1506(f)(1)(B).   </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">You also state that when you obtain the deposit, you “</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">will attach both of our scripts and will show in each script a page by page comparison of similarities.</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">”</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">  While you may file such documents, an exhaustive comparison is not required.  You need only show substantial similarity between aspects of the works that copyright protects.  If you include copies of the works as supplemental documents, they must be clearly labeled and identified so that they can be properly compared to each other.  If you submit an amended claim, include more specific allegations that support the element of substantial similarity, </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">for example, by identifying particular scenes and details in the respondents’ work that are similar to </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">copyrightable expression in your work, and describing how they are similar.  Your description should help the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">respondents and the Board understand the similarities you see between the respondents’ allegedly infringing work </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">and the protectable aspects of your work. </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Final Amendment</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> Your amended claim resolves some, but not all, of the issues raised in the April 23, 2024 noncompliance order.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">This is your third and final opportunity to submit a compliant claim.
