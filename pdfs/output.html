If you wish to proceed with this claim, you must file a second amended claim by </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">April 17, 2025</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">.  If you </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">do not, the Board must dismiss your claim without prejudice, although you may file again in the future before the Board or in federal court.  There is no additional filing fee for an amended claim.  If you file a second amended claim and it is found compliant, you will be notified and directed to proceed with service.  However, if your second amended claim also is found not to comply, the Board will dismiss the proceeding without prejudice.  17 U.S.C. § 1506(f)(1)(B); 37 C.F.R. § 224.1(d).   To make your second amended claim compliant, you must resolve the issues identified below.  37 C.F.R. § 224.1(c)(2).  You may also choose to correct or edit any errors or other information in your claim before you file it again.

The Complaint indicates that OVO “is owned by Drake,” but it does not present a basis to consider OVO responsible for any infringement by Drake or by anyone else.

To address this issue, if you file a second amended claim, it must include specific facts that provide a basis for raising the claim against each named respondent.

The facts you allege do not indicate </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">that “Wobble” </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">was so widely distributed that access by Drake or by any named respondent was reasonably likely </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">before the recording of “Rich Baby Daddy.”</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> To address this issue, you must file a second amended claim with allegations that make access a reasonable possibility, not just hypothetically or theoretically possible.  Acceptable allegations of access may include how your work (a) was sent directly to the respondents, or a close associate of the respondents; (b) was widely disseminated or available to the respondents; or (c) is so strikingly similar to the allegedly infringing work that the respondents could not have created their work independently.   Alternatively, you can upload copies of your work and the allegedly infringing work if they demonstrate that the works are so strikingly similar that they could not have been created independently.  If you include copies of the works at issue as supplemental documents, for example, by providing the lyrics, sheet music, or sound recordings, they must be clearly labeled and identified so they can be properly compared to each other.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Substantial Similarity</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> Your amended claim also does not include enough facts to indicate how the allegedly infringing work is substantially similar to original, expressive elements of your work that copyright protects.  To address this issue, if you file an amended claim, include more information about your work, the allegedly infringing work, and how creative elements of the works are similar. Copyright protection only extends to the specific creative expression in a work that is original to the author.  Information about copyrightable authorship is available in Sections 302, 308, and 313.4 of </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Chapter 300</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> of the <span style="position:absolute; border: black 1px solid; left:456px; top:3862px; width:60px; height:0px;"></span>

The repetition of common words and phrases in the hook or chorus of a song is standard practice and does not make the songs substantially similar, even in songs of the same genre and style.  Your allegations do not show how material in the works that copyright protects are substantially similar.  In addition, you have not provided copies of the works as supplemental documents.  As a result, the amended claim does not provide enough information to enable the Board or respondents to understand the similarity of the works.   If you submit a second amended claim, it must include more factual allegations that support the element of substantial similarity, including facts that show that elements of your work that were copied would be protected by copyright.  Please provide more details and background regarding this element in your amended claim, including a clear, detailed statement regarding which portions of your work were taken by the respondents in the allegedly infringing work, or documents that are sufficient to show substantial similarity in material that copyright protects.  If you include copies of the works at issue as supplemental documents, then as discussed above, they must be clearly labeled and identified so they can be properly compared to each other. </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Final Amendment</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> Your amended claim resolves some of the compliance issues raised in the February 20, 2025 Order to Amend Noncompliant Claim, and raises additional issues, also discussed in this order, that must be resolved for the claim to move forward.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">This is your third and final opportunity to submit a compliant claim in this proceeding.
