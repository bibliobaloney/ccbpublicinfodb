When you submit an amended claim, you must more fully explain how </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Italic; font-size:12px">each</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> respondent infringed each of your allegedly infringed works.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">To address this issue, your amended claim must include facts in the “Describe the infringement” section that describe (1) acts infringing your copyrights in the works, specifying the infringing works </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">and how the respondents engaged in the infringing activity, and (2) the infringing acts of each respondent, specifying the allegedly infringed and infringing works for each respondent.  You should be as detailed as possible, setting forth what each respondent did in relation to each work you allege was infringed.  If you cannot state facts to support an infringement claim about any particular works, or against any named respondents, you must omit them in the amended claim. </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Access </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> Your claim does not provide facts about how the respondent had access to your work.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“Access” means a </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">reasonable opportunity to view or hear your work before the alleged infringement took place. To address this issue, you must file an amended claim with allegations that make access a reasonable possibility, not just hypothetically or theoretically possible.  Acceptable allegations of access may include how your work (a) was sent directly to the respondent or a close associate of the respondent; (b) was widely disseminated or was available to the respondent; </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">or (c) is so strikingly similar to the respondent’s work that the respondent could not have created </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">it independently.  Alternatively, you can upload copies of your work and the allegedly infringing work if they demonstrate that the works are so strikingly similar that they could not have been created independently.  In your claim, you do not give any additional information how the respondent had access to your animation work.  You </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">have included supplementary documents that appear to show either your work or the respondents’ work</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">, but it is hard to tell what is attached.  If you include copies of the works at issue as supplemental documents, they must be clearly labeled and identified so they can be properly compared to each other.  <span style="position:absolute; border: gray 1px solid; left:0px; top:1734px; width:612px; height:792px;"></span>

</span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Substantial Similarity </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> Your claim also does not include enough facts that explain the similarities between your work and the respondents</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">’</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> allegedly infringing work.  If it is not readily apparent from supplemental documents that are submitted with the claim, you must provide some specific allegations about how your work and the allegedly infringing work are similar. Your claim states that your work is an animation.  You have included conflicting allegations that the respondent </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">puts my Copyrighted Content in his video sum 6 times</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">”</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">and “[d]</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">id not make any significant changes or add any new value whatsoever his use serves for the same purpose as my original video as he just blatantly copy and paste my video in his.</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">”  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">However, it is unclear how much of your work or which elements of your work are used in the respondents</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">’</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> work.  As noted above, you have included supplementary documents that appear to show either your </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">work or the respondents’ work</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">, but it is hard to tell what is attached.  Several of the supplementary videos you have uploaded appear to be trying to describe the copying/similarities, but it is hard to decipher because the clips are only a couple of seconds long.  Additionally, you do not provide enough information describing or showing your work.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">No allegations in the “Describe the infringement” field of the claim describe your work or the allegedly </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">infringing work, or clearly state or show how they are identical or substantially similar.  As a result, the claim does not provide enough information to enable the respondent to understand the claim and respond to it.  When you submit an amended claim, it must include more allegations that support the element of substantial similarity.  Please provide more details and background regarding this element in your amended claim, including a clear, detailed statement regarding which portions of your work were taken by the respondent in the allegedly infringing work, or documents that are sufficient to show the similarities.  If you include copies of the works at issue as supplemental documents, they must be clearly labeled and identified so they can be properly compared to each other. More information about the elements required to assert a claim of copyright infringement is available in the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Starting an Infringement Claim</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> chapter of the CCB Handbook. <span style="position:absolute; border: black 1px solid; left:53px; top:2227px; width:159px; height:0px;"></span>
