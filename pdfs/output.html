Claim</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> chapter of the CCB Handbook.   <span style="position:absolute; border: black 1px solid; left:36px; top:1000px; width:30px; height:0px;"></span>
Your claim does not present enough facts to clearly state how the alleged infringer used any exclusive rights you have in the sound recording and photograph without permission.  In </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">the “Describe the infringement” section</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> of the claim, you state that Mr. Marchant </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">called your office and obtained your photograph and voice recording “to display and promote defamation against me on the Internet.”  However, you do not clearly allege, for example, </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">how and in what way the respondent, without your authorization, displayed the photograph or distributed the sound recording.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">If you submit an amended claim, you must include facts in the “Describe the infringement” section that describe </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">acts infringing your copyrights, specifying how the named respondent engaged in the infringing activity.  You should be as detailed as possible, setting forth what the respondent did in relation to each allegedly infringed work. In addition, your allegations about the sound recording appear to describe activity that a copyright infringement claim cannot address.  To qualify for copyright protection, a sound recording must be recorded by the author or with authorization from the author.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">The “Works infringed” section of the claim describes the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">allegedly infringed recording as </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">a “sound recording in my Geneva Office . . . with David Marchan[t]/Offshorealert and Sam Zumba.”  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">A Board review of the deposit you submitted to the Copyright Office to obtain registration for that work indicates that it is a copy of a phone call in which Mr. Marchant called your office and spoke with you and Mr. Zumba, who told Mr. Marchant shortly </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">before ending the call: “you do not have permission to tape this recording, ‘cause</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> I know </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">you are.”</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">  You appear to allege that Mr. Marchant recorded the call without your authorization and then posted the recording online.  The unauthorized recording of a phone conversation, or a distribution of a recording of that conversation, is not an act of copyright infringement.  An amended claim that asserts infringement of the sound recording cannot move forward unless it shows that, despite the content of the deposit copy, you made or authorized the original recording.  Alternatively, you may file an amended claim that omits the sound recording </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">from the list of allegedly infringed works in the “Works infringed” section.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Access</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> Your claim does not clearly name the respondent or provide clear facts that indicate how the respondent had access to your works in the first place</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">.  “Access” means a reasonable opportunity to </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">hear, see, or copy your works before the alleged infringement took place.  You indicate that Mr. Marchant obtained the sound recording by calling your office to record it, but you have not named Mr. Marchant as a respondent.  You also allege that he obtained your photograph, but you do not state any facts that indicate where or how the photograph was available to him, or how either work was available to the respondent. To address this issue, you must submit an amended claim with allegations that make access a reasonable </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:11px">possibility, not just hypothetically or theoretically possible.  Acceptable allegations of access may include how your </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">work(s) (a) were sent directly to the respondent or a close associate of the respondent(s); (b) were widely <span style="position:absolute; border: gray 1px solid; left:0px; top:1734px; width:612px; height:792px;"></span>
<div style="position:absolute; top:1734px;"><a name="3">Page 3</a></div>
disseminated or were available to the respondent; or (c) are so strikingly similar to </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">the respondent’s works</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> that the respondent could not have created them independently.  Alternatively, you can upload copies of your work(s) and the allegedly infringing work(s) if they demonstrate that the works are so strikingly similar that they could not have been created independently.  If you include copies of the works at issue as supplemental materials, they must be clearly labeled and identified so they can be properly compared to each other.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Substantial Similarity</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> Your claim also does not include enough facts that explain the similarities between your work(s) and any allegedly infringing work(s).  If it is not readily apparent from supplemental documents submitted with the claim, you must provide specific allegations about how your work(s) and the allegedly infringing work(s) are substantially similar.  You allege generally that Mr. Marchant obtained the photograph and sound recording, but you do not identify any work used by a named respondent or any allegedly infringing work, and you do not state or show how your works and the allegedly infringing works are identical or substantially similar.  You list several hyperlinks in the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“Where the alleged infringing acts occurred” section, but </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">in part because hyperlinks can lead to material that is no longer available online, the Board will not take into account material that is solely referred to in a hyperlink and not </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">uploaded as supplemental material in the “Supplemental documentation” sectio</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">n.  In addition, you have not provided a copy of any of the works as supplemental material.  As a result, the claim does not provide enough information to enable the Board to understand the similarity of the works.   If you submit an amended claim, it must include more factual allegations that support the element of substantial similarity.  Please provide more details and background regarding this element in your amended claim, including a clear, detailed statement regarding which portions of each allegedly infringed work was used by the respondent, or documents that are sufficient to show the similarities.  Upload any relevant material you want the Board to review as supplemental material, not just as hyperlinks.  If you include copies of the works as supplemental material, then as discussed above, they must be clearly labeled and identified so they can be properly compared. </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Relief Requested</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">The Board is only authorized to provide remedies for certain copyright claims.  Information about the forms of relief available from the Board can be found in the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Damages</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> chapter of the CCB Handbook.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">In the “Description <span style="position:absolute; border: black 1px solid; left:273px; top:2311px; width:48px; height:0px;"></span>
of harm suffered and relief sought” sections of your infringement claim</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> and of your misrepresentation claim, you allege a wide range of activity for which the Board cannot provide relief, including criminal offenses, violations of FATCA and of Titles 12, 31, and 37 of the U.S. Code, and conspiracy to defraud.  If you submit an amended claim, do not allege that you are pursuing remedies from the Board that it may not provide. </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Misrepresentation</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> You are bringing a claim of misrepresentation in connection with a takedown notice or counter-notice under 17 </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:11px">U.S.C. § 512(f).  A misrepresentation claim must allege that the respondent made a false or incorrect statement to an </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">online service provider (OSP) related to a copyright-protected work posted online.  Your misrepresentation <span style="position:absolute; border: gray 1px solid; left:0px; top:2576px; width:612px; height:792px;"></span>
<div style="position:absolute; top:2576px;"><a name="4">Page 4</a></div>
allegations do not describe a violation of section 512(f).  You allege that you sent Google and/or Lumen Database </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">more than 100 takedown notices (“complaints”), and that you have also sent them counter</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">-notices, but you do not describe any notice, counter-notice, or other statement that anyone other than you made to an OSP.  You also include several hyperlinks to a page on Lumen Database where you assert the contents of your takedown notices are </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">available, and you state, “you will find all the details online.”  However, as discussed above, the Board does not </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">review those hyperlinks. Allegations and facts in support of the claim must be within the claim to be considered as part of the claim.  Without allegations or documents that indicate that the respondent made a misrepresentation to an OSP, and that the OSP relied on the misrepresentation to restore or remove the allegedly infringing material, your misrepresentation claim cannot go forward.  If you submit an amended claim, you must omit the misrepresentation claim or include enough facts to support the elements of the claim.  More information about the elements of a misrepresentation claim is available in the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Starting a Misrepresentation Claim</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> chapter of the CCB Handbook. <span style="position:absolute; border: black 1px solid; left:231px; top:2846px; width:177px; height:0px;"></span>
