That assertion is incompatible with a claim of </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">copyright infringement against the respondent, because an owner or co-owner of a copyright cannot be liable for </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">infringement of that copyright.

Here, it appears that the intention at the time of creation of the musical composition was that the contributions of you and Diego Castillo were to be combined into an integrated unit.  A valid copyright only extends to copyrightable subject matter, and copyright law only protects the components of a work that are original to the author.  Copyright law does not protect concepts or ideas; it only protects original elements of expression. As such, it appears that the respondent is the co-owner of the copyright in the allegedly infringed work and cannot be liable for a claim of copyright infringement. Additionally, your claim appears to discuss the creation of musical compositions and sound recordings.  Although the registration included with the claim does include the sound recordings of the works, the facts included with the claim indicate that the respondent may own some or all of the copyright in the sound recordings and/or the musical compositions, and thus cannot be liable for a claim of copyright infringement.   When a song is recorded, it may create two works that are protected by copyright: a musical work and a sound recording.  A sound recording of the music, lyrics, words, or other content included in the recording is a separately copyright-protected work.  A musical work </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">is a song’s underlying composition along with any </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">accompanying lyrics.  A sound recording is a series of musical, spoken, or other sounds fixed in a recording medium, such as a CD or </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">digital file, called a “phonorecord.”</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Sound recordings can be created by the recording’s performer, the producer, or </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">others.  More information about joint ownership of a copyright is available at pages 9-10 of the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Responding to an <span style="position:absolute; border: black 1px solid; left:480px; top:1243px; width:89px; height:0px;"></span>
Infringement Claim</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> chapter of the CCB Handbook.  If you file an amended claim, you will need to clarify the <span style="position:absolute; border: black 1px solid; left:36px; top:1263px; width:100px; height:0px;"></span>
circumstances surrounding the creation of both the underlying musical composition and the sound recording.    If the information you have given regarding the co-ownership of your alleged work is incorrect, you should correct that information if you file an amended claim.  However, if the respondent is a co-owner of the copyright, you cannot raise an infringement claim against them before the Board.  Joint owners generally must share any income they receive from their use and licensing of the work with the other owners, but a claim about failing to </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">make such payments is called an “accounting” claim, which is not a claim that the Boar</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">d can hear.
