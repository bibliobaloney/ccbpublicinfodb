If you file an amended claim and it is found compliant, you will be notified and directed to proceed with service.  There is no additional filing fee for an amended claim.  17 U.S.C. § 1506(f)(1)(B). To make your amended claim compliant, you must resolve the issues identified below.  37 C.F.R. § 224.1(c)(2).  You may also choose to correct or edit any errors or other information in your claim before you file it again.  For example, the name you entered for the respondent is almost identical to the name of one of the claimants, and if the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">respondent’s name is incorrect</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">, you should correct it in the amended claim.

If you file an amended claim, it must include enough details about those elements for the Board and the respondent to understand the facts of the alleged infringement.   </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Legal or Beneficial Ownership </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">To bring an </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">infringement claim before the Board, the claimant must be “the legal or beneficial owner of the exclusive right [in a copyrighted work] at the time of the infringement.” </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> 17 U.S.C. § 1504(c)(1).  A legal owner is an author of the work who owns the exclusive rights at issue, or a person or entity that has received a transfer of those rights, for example, by an assignment or an exclusive license.  A beneficial owner is a legal owner who has transferred the rights at issue but retains some of the advantages of ownership, such as the right to receive royalties from the use of the work.  More information about legal and beneficial ownership is available at page 4 of the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Starting an Infringement Claim</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> chapter of the CCB Handbook.  A claimant who is not an author or named <span style="position:absolute; border: black 1px solid; left:36px; top:1255px; width:159px; height:0px;"></span>
copyright owner of the allegedly infringed work must provide some specific details or supplemental documents explaining how the claimant owns, or has an exclusive license to use, the exclusive rights at issue. The claim names two claimants, Artion Marra (Marra) and Getchecked Poly Clinic Co LLC (Getchecked).  It is not clear that Marra is a proper claimant for this claim.  Marra filed and certified the application for registration, and the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Italic; font-size:12px">claim</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> names Marra as the author of the allegedly infringed work.  However, the application and registration list Getchecked as the sole author of the work and as the sole copyright claimant (owner).  Copyright Office records do not name Marra as an author of the work or indicate that Marra is a legal or beneficial owner of the copyright.   To address this issue in an amended claim, you must include allegations that indicate how Marra is a legal or beneficial owner of the copyright for the allegedly infringed work.  Alternatively, if Marra is not a legal or beneficial owner, then any amended claim must remove Marra as a claimant.  Also, the amended claim must name Getchecked as the author of the work instead of Marra, or it must include allegations that indicate how Marra is an author (and if and how it then assigned copyright rights to Getchecked), despite the information in the copyright registration. </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Proper Respondent </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">The claim names Sulaimaan Syed </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">(Syed) in the “Respondent” section.  However, the claim does not otherwise </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">mention Syed, and the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">allegations in the “Describe the infringement” </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">seem to suggest that a company is infringing.  To address this issue in an amended claim, either include facts that indicate why Syed personally is the alleged infringer, or name a different respondent, stating facts that indicate how that respondent infringed. <span style="position:absolute; border: gray 1px solid; left:0px; top:1734px; width:612px; height:792px;"></span>

</span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Respondent Address </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">The </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">claim must include the respondent’s mailing address.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">37 C.F.R. § 222.2(c)(6).  The address you provided for Syed is incomplete.  It lists a borough, neighborhood, city, and state </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">(“Manhattan, Chelsea, Midtown South</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">, New York, NY</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">”), but not a street address.  In addition, </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">the zip code listed, 84001, is in Utah, not New York.   Provide a complete and accurate mailing address for the respondent in your amended claim.  It must be a United States address, as the Board cannot hear a claim asserted against a person or entity residing outside the United States. 17 U.S.C. § 1504(d)(4).  Even if you fix the other issues listed in this order, a claim cannot move forward without a valid United States address for each respondent. </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Access </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Your claim does not provide facts about how the respondent had access to the allegedly infringed work. </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“Access” </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">means a reasonable opportunity to view or copy the work before the alleged infringement took place.   To address this issue, you must file an amended claim with allegations that make access a reasonable possibility, not just hypothetically or theoretically possible.  Acceptable allegations of access may include how your work (a) was sent directly to the respondent or a close associate of the respondent; (b) was widely disseminated or was available to the respondent; or (c) is </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">so strikingly similar to the respondent’s work that the</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">y could not have been created independently.   Alternatively, you can upload copies of your work and the allegedly infringing work if they demonstrate that the works are so strikingly similar that they could not have been created independently.  Your claim does not include copies of the works.  You list URLs in the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“Describe the work” and</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“Where the allegedly infringing acts occurred” </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">sections of the claim, but when reviewing claims, the Board will not take into account material that is solely referred to in URLs and not uploaded as supplemental documents, in part because URLs can lead to material that is no longer available online.  If you include copies of the works as supplemental documents, they must be clearly labeled and identified so they can be properly compared to each other.   </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Substantial Similarity </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Your claim also does not include enough facts that explain the similarities between your work and the allegedly infringing work.  If it is not readily apparent from supplemental documents submitted with the claim, you must provide some specific allegations about how your work and the allegedly infringing work are substantially similar. Your claim does not provide enough information describing or showing your work or the allegedly infringing work.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">In the “Describe the infringement” section, you state, “</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">This website has copied almost 100% our website on STD/STI Wellness Page and Food Intolerance page.</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">”  Those allegations are not clear enough to </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">state or show how the works are identical or substantially similar.  In addition, you have not provided copies of the works as supplemental documents.  As a result, the claim does not provide enough information to enable the respondent to understand the claim and respond to it.   <span style="position:absolute; border: gray 1px solid; left:0px; top:2576px; width:612px; height:792px;"></span>
<div style="position:absolute; top:2576px;"><a name="4">Page 4</a></div>
If you submit an amended claim, it must include more factual allegations or information that support the element of substantial similarity.  Please provide more details and background regarding this element in your amended claim, including a clear, detailed statement regarding which portions of your work were taken by the respondent in the allegedly infringing work, or documents that are sufficient to show the similarities.  If you include copies of the works at issue as supplemental documents, as discussed above, they must be clearly labeled and identified so they can be properly compared to each other.
