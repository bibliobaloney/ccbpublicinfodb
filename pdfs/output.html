23, 2025, with an effective date of registration of August 23, 2024. </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">In the “Describe the infringement” section of the claim, you allege: “</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Part of my video was used without permission on a video published at TheBentist Youtube Channel.</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">”  You further allege that “</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Youtube removed the video due to our claim, but TheBentist channel made a counternotice.</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">”  However, your allegations do not </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">clearly </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">describe infringement of the “</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Gingivectomy Treatment of Gummy Smile</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">” video that is covered by the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">PA 2-512-325 registration.  Instead, documents filed with the claim show that the takedown notice and counter-notice sent to YouTube relate to a different video title</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">d “COLMILLOS INCLUIDOS o retenidos –</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> Qué hacer si no salen los CANINOS u otros dientes.</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">”</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">You allege that the respondent’s YouTube channel is using multiple videos of yours without authorization, but you do not specifically allege that the respondent infringed the “</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Gingivectomy Treatment of Gummy Smile</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">” video, or any other video that is registered or subject to a pending applicatio</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">n for registration filed before this claim. If the respondent used </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Gingivectomy Treatment of Gummy Smile</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">” without authorization, then </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">you must state that allegation in an amended claim, and </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">in the “Works infringed” section, </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">you must list that title and include the PA 2-512-325 registration number and its August 23, 2024 effective date of registration.  However, if that was not one of the infringed works, </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">then in the “Works infringed” section you must provide either a copyright registration </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">number for the allegedly infringed work(s), or a service request number for an application to register the work(s) </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">that was filed before you filed this claim on August 23, 2024,</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> and that is still pending.  Providing service request number 1-14163683091 would only be appropriate if the Copyright Office reopens that application.   You cannot successfully amend this claim to allege infringement of any work that, when you filed this claim on August 23, 2024, was not registered and was not subject to an open, pending application.  Instead, you would need to apply to register the copyright for the allegedly infringed work before you could refile your claim as a new claim.

</span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Access</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> You allege that </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">the respondent “is using our videos without authorization.”  However, your claim does not</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> provide facts that indicate how the respondent had access to your works in the first place</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">.  “Access” means a </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">reasonable opportunity to see or copy your work before the alleged infringement took place.  You state that your </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">videos are “</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">marketed to other dental clinics,</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">”</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> but you do not present enough facts to indicate how it is reasonably likely that your videos were available to the respondent. To address this issue, you must file an amended claim with allegations that make access a reasonable possibility, not just hypothetically or theoretically possible.  Acceptable allegations of access may include how each allegedly infringed work (a) was sent directly to the respondent or a close associate of the respondent; (b) was widely disseminated or was available to the respondent; or (c) is so strikingly similar to </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">the respondent’s work</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> that the respondent could not have created it independently.   </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:11px">Alternatively, you can upload copies of your work(s) and the allegedly infringing work(s) if they demonstrate </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">that the works are so strikingly similar that they could not have been created independently.  If you include copies <span style="position:absolute; border: gray 1px solid; left:0px; top:1734px; width:612px; height:792px;"></span>
<div style="position:absolute; top:1734px;"><a name="3">Page 3</a></div>
of the works at issue as supplemental materials, they must be clearly labeled and identified so they can be properly compared to each other.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Substantial Similarity</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> Your claim also does not include enough facts that explain the similarities between your work(s) and the allegedly infringing work(s).  If it is not readily apparent from supplemental documents submitted with the claim, you must provide specific allegations about how your work(s) and the allegedly infringing work(s) are substantially similar. </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">In the “Describe the infringement” section of your claim, you state that “[p]art of my video” was used on the respondent’s channel, but you do not indicate which part, </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">how it was used, or how long it appeared in the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">respondent’s video.  You also allege that videos on the respondent’s channel are “</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">based on an original work of ours</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">,” but it is not clear </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">how they are based on your work, and which work.  It is not clear if you mean that the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">respondent’s </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">videos include material directly copied and reproduced from your video (and if so, which material </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">from which video), or that they include material that is “based on” your video because, for example, it uses similar </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">images or text derived from your video.  You do not present enough information about your works and the allegedly infringing works to state or show how they are identical or substantially similar.  In addition, you have not provided </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">copies of any of your works or the respondent’s works</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> as supplemental material.  As a result, the claim does not provide enough information to enable the Board to understand the similarity of the works.   If you submit an amended claim, it must include more factual allegations that support the element of substantial similarity.  Please provide more details and background regarding this element in your amended claim, including a clear, detailed statement regarding which portions of your work(s) the respondent used, or documents that are sufficient to show the similarities.  If you include copies of the works as supplemental material, then as discussed above, they must be clearly labeled and identified so they can be properly compared to each other.
