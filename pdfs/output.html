It appears that some or all of your works may have been created for the Restaurant to use, but you have not clearly alleged that you provided the works to the Restaurant, and your claim does not indicate any other way it may have gained access. To address this issue, you must file an amended claim with allegations that make access a reasonable possibility, not just hypothetically or theoretically possible.  You must make allegations regarding access for each of the works you claim were infringed.  Acceptable allegations of access may include how your works (a) were sent directly to the respondent or a close associate of the respondent; (b) were widely disseminated or were available to the respondent; or (c) are so strikingly similar to the respond</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">ent’s work</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">s that the respondent could not have created them independently.

In addition, you do not appear to have provided copies of your works as supplemental documents.  As a result, the claim does not provide enough information to enable the respondent to understand the claim and respond to it.   If you submit an amended claim, it must include more factual allegations that support the element of substantial similarity.  Please provide more details and background regarding this element in your amended claim, including a clear, detailed statement regarding which portions of your works were taken by the respondent in the allegedly infringing works, or documents that are sufficient to show the similarities.
