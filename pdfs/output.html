The claim cannot move forward unless it is amended. </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">If you wish to proceed with this claim, you must file an amended claim by </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">January 22, 2024</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">.

If you file an amended claim and it is found compliant, you will be notified and directed to proceed with service.  There is no additional filing fee for an amended claim.  17 U.S.C. § 1506(f)(1)(B). To make your amended claim compliant, you must resolve the issues identified below.  37 C.F.R. § 224.1(c)(2).  You may also choose to correct or edit any errors or other information in your claim before you file it again.  You do not need to provide a legal argument in your claim </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">–</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> just a statement of facts and circumstances.

For each respondent you name as an alleged </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">infringer, you must state allegations regarding that respondent’s allegedly infringing </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">activity.  You have not stated or </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">shown that McPherson engaged in any infringing act. You describe </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">the allegedly infringed work as a “[p]hoto of </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Arthur Russell sitting cross legged on the beach with a microphone</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">.”  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">In the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“Where the alleged infringing acts occurred” section of the claim, you indicate that the photograph appeared “</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">on the back the Arthur Russell Corn CD cover</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">,” </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">as well as on Instagram and in several </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">online music publications, and that Tom Lee “</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">has told me he has lost track of how many times they have used this photo without telling me or giving me credit or compensation</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">.”  In the “Describe the infringement” section, you state, “</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Tom Lee and Steve Knutson have knowingly used this photo over and over again, without my knowledge or permission</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">, claiming that Tom Lee took [the photograph].”  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Text messages submitted in supplemental documents indicate that both Lee and Knutson may have played roles in the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">release of the allegedly infringing “Corn” CD.</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">    <span style="position:absolute; border: black 1px solid; left:320px; top:195px; width:240px; height:0px;"></span>

By contrast, your allegations about McPherson </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">are that he is Lee and Knutson’s lawyer, and that he called you “spiteful” when you asked them to cease infringement.  You do not indicate that he engaged in any infringing act.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> Copyright law grants exclusive rights to copyright owners.  These include the right to reproduce, distribute, and publicly display </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">the work, and to make a “derivative work,” which is a work based on the original work.  Someone who does one of those activities without the copyright owner’s permission may be infringing the copyright, unless</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> the use is otherwise authorized.  Your claim does not state facts that clearly describe McPherson copying, distributing, or displaying the photograph, or participating in making a derivative work based on the photograph.  You have not stated enough facts explaining allegedly infringing activities by McPherson so that he can understand the nature of the claim against him. If you file an amended claim, it must include allegations that state or show how each named respondent engaged in infringing activity.  You must provide specific details regarding particular infringing acts by each respondent.  Alternatively, if McPherson did not participate in any infringing act, you should omit him from your amended claim. In addition, all participants in a Board proceeding, including parties and their representatives, are required to meet certain basic standards of conduct.  37 C.F.R. § 232.1.  These standards include acting with the highest degree of respect for others.  If you fail to meet these standards and instead act in bad faith, the Board may impose financial penalties on you or even ban you from bringing new claims before the Board.  37 C.F.R. § 232.4.  Bad-faith conduct includes violating those standards of conduct, or making a claim or taking any actions in support of a claim for some inappropriate purpose, such as to harass someone.  Your claim includes allegations unrelated to copyright that attack the reputation of a respondent regarding alleged drug use.  In your amended claim, please only include allegations directly related to your copyright infringement dispute.  You are permitted to submit a document or other information to the Board, make a claim, or take a position before the Board only if you have a legitimate reason for doing so.   To submit an amended claim, log into your eCCB account and take the following steps: 1.</span><span style="font-family: ArialMT; font-size:12px"> </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">From your dashboard, click the “</span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Amend claim</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">” button and select your docket </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">number from the dropdown list. 2.</span><span style="font-family: ArialMT; font-size:12px"> </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Your claim will unlock for editing.
