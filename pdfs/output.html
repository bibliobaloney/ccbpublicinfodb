Copyright law grants exclusive rights to copyright owners.  These include the right to reproduce, distribute, and publicly perform </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">the work, and to make a “derivative work,” which is a work based on the original work.  Someone who does one of those activities without the copyright owner’s permission may be infringing the copyright, unless </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">they have a legitimate defense.  More information about exclusive rights is available on page 3 of the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Starting an <span style="position:absolute; border: black 1px solid; left:504px; top:1060px; width:55px; height:0px;"></span>

</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">You have named two respondents, Marc Billings and BlackDove.  Each respondent’s role in the alleged infringement is not clear.  You assert that “</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">BlackDove.Com is infringing on my work</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">,” and that your image is being </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">used on the website, though you have asked for its removal.  However, your claim does not provide enough facts about how either respondent used one of your exclusive rights in the work without permission, or is responsible for the alleged infringement on BlackDove.Com.  If you choose to leave these respondents in any amended claim you file, you must provide more details and background regarding how </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Italic; font-size:12px">each of them </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">engaged in infringing activity.   In addition, if you file an amended claim with BlackDove as a respondent, please confirm that you provide the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">entity’s full name (for example, BlackDove Inc., BlackDove Corporation, or BlackDove LLC), as the case may be.</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Access</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> Your claim does not provide facts that indicate how the respondents </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">had access to your work.  “Access” means </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">a reasonable opportunity to hear your work before the alleged infringement took place.  Your claim does not clearly state allegations about where or how your work was available before the alleged infringement so that the respondents had an opportunity to see it.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">You allege that “[t]</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">he image has been available for usage on his site since an initial notice by me of my intentions to no longer participate in September 2020.</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">”  However, the claim does not </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">indicate how the respondents would have had access to the image to post it on the website in the first place.  You also allege</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">, “</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">I discovered the image was still being used after I disclosed that I no long was interested in participating in the website (September 2020).</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">”</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">  These allegations may suggest that you gave permission to use the work on the website at some point, and perhaps that you uploaded or otherwise provided it to the website yourself, but it is not clearly stated in the claim. To address this issue, you must file an amended claim with allegations that make access a reasonable possibility, not just hypothetically or theoretically possible.  Acceptable allegations of access may include that your work (a) was sent directly to the respondents or a close associate of the respondents; (b) was widely disseminated or was available to the public or respondents; or (c) is so strikingly similar to the work that appeared on the respondents</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">’ </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">website that they could not have created it independently.  If you provided a copy of the work to the respondents, or had any other relationship or agreement with them related to using the work on the website, you may also describe that </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:11px">relationship or agreement, and how it ended or terminated.  If you gave permission to use the work on the website, </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">but then withdrew that permission, describe when and how that permission was both given and withdrawn. <span style="position:absolute; border: gray 1px solid; left:0px; top:1734px; width:612px; height:792px;"></span>
<div style="position:absolute; top:1734px;"><a name="3">Page 3</a></div>
Alternatively, you can upload copies of your work and the allegedly infringing work if they demonstrate that the works are so strikingly similar that they could not have been created independently.  You included an image file with your claim, labeled </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Endless Clouds.jpg</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">, which appears to be a copy of your work, but you have not provided a <span style="position:absolute; border: black 1px solid; left:125px; top:1821px; width:98px; height:0px;"></span>
copy of the allegedly infringing work.  If you include copies of the works at issue as supplemental documents, they must be clearly labeled and identified so they can be properly compared to each other.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Substantial Similarity</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> Your claim also does not include enough facts that explain the similarities between your work and the allegedly infringing work.  If it is not readily apparent from supplemental documents that are submitted with the claim, you must provide more specific allegations about how your work and the allegedly infringing work are similar. </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">In the “Works infringed” section of the claim, you </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">describe your work as </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">a photograph that was converted into a moving image</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">”</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">titled “</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Endless Clouds,</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">”</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> and the supplemental document filed with the claim appears to be a copy of your work.  However, the claim does not clearly describe the allegedly infringing work or include it as a supplemental document.  It is not clear whether the allegedly infringing image on the website is the photograph that </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">was registered with the Copyright Office, “a moving image” that the photograph “was converted into,” or some </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">other image.  As a result, the claim does not provide enough information to enable the Board to understand the similarity of the works.   If you submit an amended claim, it must include more factual allegations that support the element of substantial similarity.  Please provide more details and background regarding this element in your amended claim, including a clear, detailed statement regarding which portions of your work were taken by the respondent in the allegedly infringing work, or documents that are sufficient to show the similarities.  If you include copies of the works at issue as supplemental documents, then as discussed above, they must be clearly labeled and identified so they can be properly compared to each other. </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Clarity </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">–</span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px"> Allegedly Infringed Work</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">In the “Works infringed” section, you describe the allegedly infringed work as a photograph that has been </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">registered by the Copyright Office with Registration No. VA0001901946.  That registration issued for a group of </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">photographs, including one titled “Endless Clouds.”  However, in the “Works infringed” section, you also state that the photograph “was converted into a moving image” at some point, and you selected “Motion pictur</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">e and </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">audiovisual” as the “Type of work.”  That selection is confusing and appear</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">s to contradict your other allegations.  If </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">you file an amended claim, select “Pictorial, graphic or sculptural” from the “Type of work” drop</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">-down menu to indicate that your work is a photograph.
