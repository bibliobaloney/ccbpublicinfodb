A legal owner is an author of the work who owns the exclusive rights at issue or a person or entity that has received a transfer of those rights, for example, by an assignment or an exclusive license.  A beneficial owner is a legal owner who has transferred the rights at issue but retains some of the advantages of ownership, such as the right to receive royalties from the use of the work.  A claimant who is not an author or named copyright owner of the allegedly infringed work must provide some specific details or supplemental documents explaining how the claimant owns, or has an exclusive license to use, the exclusive rights at issue.  The claim does not present facts that indicate that all the named claimants are proper claimants.  As noted above, a claimant who is not an author or named copyright owner of the allegedly infringed work must provide some specific details or supplemental documents explaining how the claimant owns, or has an exclusive license to use, the exclusive rights at issue.  </span><span style="font-family: SymbolMT; font-size:12px">•</span><span style="font-family: ArialMT; font-size:12px"> </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Glenn Hollister </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">(“Hollister”)</span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">:</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">The registration information for “</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Qwik-Code ...

If Hollister transferred ownership of the work in the 2019 sale of the business, he may not be a proper claimant and should be removed from the claim.  To correct this issue, you can either (1) amend the claim to remove Hollister as a claimant or (2) provide additional information about how the legal or beneficial ownership in the work was retained by Hollister after the sale. </span><span style="font-family: SymbolMT; font-size:12px">•</span><span style="font-family: ArialMT; font-size:12px"> </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Brian Sims </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">(“Sims”)</span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">: </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Brian Sims is not listed as a copyright claimant of any of the works.

Your registration extends only to the original creative expression (potentially, the summaries) included in the works.  For an infringement claim, the respondent must have used your creative expression, not the unprotected material.  Furthermore, in this case, the infringing and infringed work must be substantially similar in the creative expression that was new to the particular edition covered by the registration.

If you amend your claim, you will need to provide concrete allegations explaining how the works are substantially similar in the copyrightable summary portions of your works.  Additionally, because hyperlinks can lead to material that is no longer available online, the Board will not take into account material that is solely referred to in a hyperlink and not uploaded as supplemental documentation.  Attach any supplemental materials that you want the Board to consider by uploading them as part of the claim rather than referring to them only with hyperlinks. When you submit an amended claim, it must include more factual allegations that support the element of substantial similarity.  Please provide more details and background regarding this element in your amended claim, including a clear, detailed statement regarding which portions of your work were taken by the respondent in the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:11px">allegedly infringing work, or documents that are sufficient to show the similarities.
