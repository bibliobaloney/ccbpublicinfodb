took place.  You allege that the infringement began on August 15, 2024, but you do not present enough information in the claim to indicate how it is reasonably likely that the respondent had access to your work in the first place To address this issue, you must file an amended claim with allegations that make access a reasonable possibility, not just hypothetically or theoretically possible.  Acceptable allegations of access may include how your work (a) was sent directly to the respondent, or a close associate of the respondent; (b) was widely disseminated or available to the respondent; or (c) is so strikingly similar to the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">respondent’s</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> work that the respondent could not have created it independently.  Alternatively, you can upload copies of your work and the allegedly infringing work if they demonstrate that the works are so strikingly similar that they could not have been created independently.  If you include copies of the works at issue as supplemental documents, they must be clearly labeled and identified so they can be properly compared to each other.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Substantial Similarity</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> Your claim also does not include enough facts to indicate how the allegedly infringing work is substantially similar to your work.  To address this issue, if you file an amended claim, include more information about your work, the allegedly infringing work, and how the works are identical or substantially similar. Copyright protection only extends to the specific creative expression in a work that is original to the author.  Information about copyrightable authorship is available in Sections 302, 308, and 313.4 of </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Chapter 300</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> of the <span style="position:absolute; border: black 1px solid; left:456px; top:1255px; width:60px; height:0px;"></span>

Not all elements of a creative work are protected by copyright, and not all similarities are infringing.  An alleged infringer must have copied your original elements of expression.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Italic; font-size:12px"> </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Your claim does not provide enough information describing or showing your work or the allegedly infringing work.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">You describe your work as “a personal photo,” and you state that the respondent “</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">is using my photos to make videos or on her Thumbnail without my permission and using it in a malicious way</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">.”  However, you have not described how much of your work appeared in the respondent’s video or thumbnail images, or for how long</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">, and you have not provided copies of the works as supplemental documents.  As a result, the claim does not provide enough information to enable the Board or the respondent to understand the alleged similarity of the works.   If you submit an amended claim, it must include more factual allegations that support the element of substantial similarity.  Please provide more details and background regarding this element in your amended claim, including a clear, detailed statement regarding which portions of your work were taken by the respondent in the allegedly infringing work, or documents that are sufficient to show substantial similarity in material that copyright protects.  If you include copies of the works at issue as supplemental documents, then as discussed above, they must be clearly labeled and identified so they can be properly compared to each other. </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Relief Sought</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">In the “</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Description of harm suffered and relief sought</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">” section of the claim, you state that you are “</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">seeking $5,000, the highest amount allowed for mental and emotional embarrassment and stress</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">.”  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">The request seeks relief <span style="position:absolute; border: gray 1px solid; left:0px; top:1734px; width:612px; height:792px;"></span>

that the Board cannot grant.  The Board can award damages based on infringement, but it cannot award damages based on emotional distress.  In a copyright infringement claim, the Board can only grant relief from activity that is found to be infringing, not from defamation or emotional harm.  17 U.S.C. §§ 1504(e)(1)(A) &amp; 1504(e)(2)(A)(i).  You should also be aware that the Board cannot hear claims that amount to defamation or are brought simply because you do not like what the respondent said about you.  A Board determination will only answer the specific questions of whether there was infringement, and if there was, what damages should be awarded based solely on that infringement.  More information about the available remedies can be found in the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Damages</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> chapter of the <span style="position:absolute; border: black 1px solid; left:439px; top:1902px; width:48px; height:0px;"></span>
