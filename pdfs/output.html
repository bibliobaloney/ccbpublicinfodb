An infringement claim can only be brought by a legal or beneficial owner of the copyright in the allegedly infringed work.  17 U.S.C. §§ 106 &amp; 501(b).  You name two claimants, M-1 Studios LLC (M-1) and Tri-Omega Productions (Tri-Omega), that do not appear to have any right to raise this infringement claim.   The allegedly infringing works are two television episodes, which </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">you listed in the “Works infringed” section of </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">the claim.

The amended claim does not identify any copyright registrations or applications for registration for any GMP work.  You may not file a second amended claim based on infringing those works unless a legal or beneficial owner of the works has authorized you to name it as the claimant, and had obtained or applied to obtain registration for the copyrights before the claim was filed on September 29, 2024. </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">The only copyright registrations </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">referenced in the amended claim are Bassquatch’s registrations for the two </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">television episodes.  Copyright Office records for those registrations do not list M-1 and Tri-Omega as copyright owners of those episodes; instead, they identify Bassquatch and Tri-Omega as the sole authors, and Bassquatch as the sole copyright owner.

claimant is a proper claimant to bring this claim.  Your amended claim clarifies that the allegedly infringed works at </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">issue are GMP’s music.  You have not asserted that M</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">-1 and Tri-Omega have any ownership of the copyrights in that music, or that they have an assignment of, or an exclusive license to use, the exclusive rights at issue in the music.  In addition, M-1 does not appear to be a legal or beneficial owner of any work at issue.  You identify it as a producer of the allegedly infringing episodes.  That does not make it an owner of any infringed work.   You may not file a second amended claim alleging infringement of any works unless you show that the claimants are legal or beneficial owners of the works. </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Infringing Activity</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> A copyright infringement is an unauthorized use of a copyrighted work.  17 U.S.C. §§ 106 &amp; 501(a).  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Information filed with the amended claim indicates that Bassquatch’s use of GMP’s music may be authorized.</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> You indicate that M-1 has renewed its annual license from GMP, and that the episodes at issue were produced </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">during the term of the previous year’s GMP license</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">, which covered the GMP music in those episodes.

If those are the facts, then </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Bassquatch’s continued use of the music in those episodes is authorized, and </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">there is no basis for the concerns stated in the amended claim that it could endanger M-</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">1’s license.</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> You may not file a second amended claim unless you state facts that show that Bassquatch is infringing your copyright.
