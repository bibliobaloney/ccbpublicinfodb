However, your claim does not provide facts that indicate how the respondent had access to your </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“Golden Trout” and “Kern River Rainbow Trout” illustrations</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> in the first place</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">.  “Access” means a </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">reasonable opportunity to see or copy your work before the alleged infringement took place.  You state that both </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">illustrations were published in a work titled “Sierra Trout Guide,”</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> but you do not state facts to indicate how that work has been distributed To address this issue, you must file an amended claim with allegations that make access a reasonable possibility, not just hypothetically or theoretically possible.  Acceptable allegations of access may include how your works (a) were sent directly to the respondent or a close associate of the respondent; (b) were widely disseminated or were available to the respondent; or (c) are so strikingly similar to the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">respondent’s </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">works that the respondent could not have created them independently.   Alternatively, you can upload copies of your works and the allegedly infringing works, if they demonstrate that the works are so strikingly similar that they could not have been created independently.  If you include copies of the works at issue as supplemental materials, they must be clearly labeled and identified so they can be properly compared to each other.  The </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">CCB Ex B.pdf</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> document filed with your claim shows images of the five allegedly <span style="position:absolute; border: black 1px solid; left:177px; top:1295px; width:72px; height:0px;"></span>

striking similarities to three of your allegedly infringed works, but the lures in the CCB Ex A document do not </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">appear strikingly similar to “Golden Trout” or “Kern River Rainbow Trout.”</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Substantial Similarity</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> Your claim also does not include enough facts that explain the similarities between </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“Golden Trout” and “Kern </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">River Rainbow Trout” </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">and any allegedly infringing works.  If it is not readily apparent from supplemental </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">documents submitted with the claim, you must provide specific allegations about how your works and the allegedly infringing works are substantially similar. Your claim does not provide enough information describing or showing any allegedly infringing work to indicate how it is substantially similar to either </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“Golden Trout” or “Kern River Rainbow Trout.” </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">In the “</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Describe </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">the infringement” </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">section, you state </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">that the respondent “</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">placed the five illustrations directly on their fishing lure products,</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">” </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">but that general assertion is not detailed enough to state or show how </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">any of respondent’s</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> works are identical or substantially similar </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">to “Golden Trout” or “Kern River Rainbow Trout.”</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">  In addition, you have not provided copies of any works substantially similar to those works as supplemental materials.

Please provide more details and background regarding this element in your amended claim, including a clear, detailed statement regarding which portions of your works were used by the respondent without authorization, or documents that are sufficient to show the similarities.  If you include copies of the works at issue as supplemental materials, then as discussed above, they must be clearly labeled and identified so they can be properly compared to each other.
