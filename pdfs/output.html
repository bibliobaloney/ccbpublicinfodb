the terms of our agreement.  Unfortunately, the original documentation has been misplaced over the course of 11 years, and I have been attempting to retrieve a copy from Mr. Morales for my records. You have not presented facts that indicate that the photographs qualify as a works made for hire.  There are only two situations in which a work made for hire is produced.  The first situation is when the work is created by an </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">employee as part of the employee’s regular duties.  The allegations in “Ownership.docx,” indicate that Mr. Morales </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">was not your legal employee.  The second situation where a work made for hire can be produced is where it is a certain type of work allowed to be a work made for hire under the law, and it is created as a result of an express written agreement between the creator and a party specially ordering or commissioning the work.  Said in another way, for a specially ordered or commissioned work to be a work made for hire, the parties must agree in writing that the work will be considered a </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“work made for hire” and the work must fall within one of nine specific categories.  See pages 2 and 3 of </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Circular <span style="position:absolute; border: black 1px solid; left:525px; top:1134px; width:40px; height:0px;"></span>

documentation saying the parties considered it a work made for hire, and such a work can only count as works </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">made for hire if it is “commissioned for use as a contribution to a collective work, as a part of a motion picture or </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">other audiovisual work, as a translation, as a supplementary work, as a compilation, as an instructional text, as a test, </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">as answer material for a test, or as an atlas.”  17 U.S.C. § 101.  The photograph</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">s do not appear to fall into any of those nine categories.  As a result, it does not appear that copyright law would treat the photograph as a work made for hire. If you submit a second amended claim, you must include more information that indicates that you are a legal or beneficial owner of the photographs at issue in this claim and shows or explains how you gained ownership of the works.  To show that the photographs were a work made for hire, you must describe facts that show that (1) Mr. Morales was your employee, and that he took the photograph in the course of his regular duties; or (2) the photographs fit one of the nine categories of works listed above that can be considered works made for hire under copyright law and the parties agreed in writing that the works would specifically be considered by the parties as works made for hire.  Alternatively, you may present facts that indicate that Mr. Morales assigned, transferred, or conveyed the copyright to you, or gave you an exclusive license to use the photographs.  However, if you present such facts, you must also show or explain why you were still seeking a transfer agreement after the photoshoot.  As discussed in the March 5, 2024 Order to Amend Noncompliant Claim, Copyright Office records indicate </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">that after the photoshoot, you asked Mr. Morales to sign a </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">‘</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">work for hire contract and copyright transfer</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">’</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> for his photographs, and that he did not sign it</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">.” </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Works Infringed</span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">—</span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Clarity </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> Your claim includes unclear allegations about how many and which of your works were allegedly infringed.

Either the registration must have been issued or the application must have been delivered to the Copyright Office before you filed your original claim on August 10, 2023.   In your amended claim, you have included several motion picture/audiovisual works that were not included with your original claim.
