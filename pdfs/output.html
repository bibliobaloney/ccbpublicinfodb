The Copyright Claims Board (Board) issued an Order to Amend Noncompliant Claim in that proceeding on February 10, </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">2025.  On March 11, 2025, instead of filing an amended claim in that docket as directed, you mistakenly filed it in this </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">proceeding, Docket No. 25-CCB-0094.  With your authorization, the Board closed Docket No. 25-CCB-0029 and is treating the claim filed in this proceeding as your amended claim. The Board finds that your claim, as amended, still does not comply with the requirements of the CASE Act and related regulations.  The claim cannot move forward unless it is properly amended.  If you wish to proceed with this claim, you must file a second amended claim in this proceeding by </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">April 21, 2025</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">.  If you do not, the Board must dismiss your claim without prejudice, although you may file again in the future before the Board or in federal court.  There is no additional filing fee for an amended claim.  If you file a second amended claim and it is found compliant you will be notified and directed to proceed with service.  However, if your second amended claim also is found not to comply, the Board will dismiss the proceeding without prejudice.  17 U.S.C. § 1506(f)(1)(B); 37 C.F.R. § 224.1(d).   To make your second amended claim compliant, you must resolve the issues identified below.  37 C.F.R. § 224.1(c)(2).  You may also choose to correct or edit any errors or other information in your claim before you file it again.  You do not need to provide a legal argument in your claim </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">–</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> just a statement of facts and circumstances.

Your amended claim does not describe any activity by Rimas, and it does not clearly state facts about activity by </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Martinez.  When you state, “</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">i need this person who sing my songs stopped to sing my song like is him who made that rythoms . . . he need to stop singing my rythoms or melody</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">,” it is not clear if the person you are describing is </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Martinez.  Your amended claim also does not clearly identify an infringing work.  Your original claim alleged infringement by </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Bad Bunny’s song “</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Baile Inolvidable</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">,” but a</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">llegations that you raised in your original claim are not part of the amended claim.  Your amended claim does not offer enough detail about either respondent using your work in a way that would infringe any exclusive rights, for example, that they copied, distributed, performed, or prepared a derivative work based on your work. If you submit a second amended claim, you must more fully explain how the respondents infringed your work.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">To address this issue, you must include facts in the “Describe the infringement” section that describe acts </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">infringing your copyrights, specifying how each respondent engaged in the infringing activity.  You should be as detailed as possible, setting forth what both respondents did in relation to the work you allege was infringed. </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Access</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> Your amended claim does not present plausible facts that indicate how either respondent had access to </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“HERMOZO ALO”</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> in the first place</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">.  “Access” means a reasonable opportunity to </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">hear or copy your work before the alleged infringement took place.   Your amended claim states that you </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">sang my own compositions in different places</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">,” </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">without further details.  That does not indicate that it is reasonably likely that any respondent heard </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“HERMOZO ALO” </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">because of those performances.  You allege that someone who has booked reggaeton performers at Utah dance clubs once tried to take your phone, which contains recordings of your songs, and you allege that an unknown computer hacker has attacked your phone and your laptop.  You do not present facts linking either respondent to those incidents or to any other way they might have had access to any of your works.   To address this issue, you must file a second amended claim with allegations that make access a reasonable possibility, not just hypothetically or theoretically possible.  Acceptable allegations of access may include how your work (a) was sent directly to the respondents or a close associate of the respondents; (b) was widely disseminated or was available to the respondents; or (c) is so strikingly similar to an allegedly infringing work that the respondents </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:11px">could not have created it independently.   <span style="position:absolute; border: gray 1px solid; left:0px; top:1734px; width:612px; height:792px;"></span>
<div style="position:absolute; top:1734px;"><a name="3">Page 3</a></div>
</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Alternatively, you can upload copies of your work and the allegedly infringing work if they demonstrate that the works are so strikingly similar that they could not have been created independently.  If you include copies of the works at issue as supplemental materials, they must be clearly labeled and identified so they can be properly compared to each other.  You included three different versions of </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“HERMOZO ALO” </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">with the amended claim, without indicating which if any of them is the registered sound recording.  You also included two short audio clips labeled </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">Baile Inolvidable,</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">”</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> but the amended claim does not clearly identify that as the allegedly infringing work, </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">and those clips are not strikingly similar to any version of “HERMOZO ALO” filed with the amended claim.</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">  If you submit audio files as supplemental documents in your second amended claim, you must clearly explain what each file is and how it relates to the infringement claim, including i</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">dentifying which “HERMOZO ALO” file is the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">registered sound recording. </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Substantial Similarity</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> Your amended claim also does not include enough facts that explain the similarities between your work and the allegedly infringing work.  If it is not readily apparent from supplemental documents submitted with the second amended claim, you must provide specific allegations about how your work and the allegedly infringing work are substantially similar.   You</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">r general allegations that someone is singing “</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">my songs</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">,” and “</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">my rythoms or melody</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">,” are not specific </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">enough to support an infringement claim.  You do not present enough facts to state or show how the works are substantially similar.  Even if </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“Baile Inolvidable” </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">is the allegedly infringing work, the samples provided do not </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">appear similar to any of the “HERMOZO ALO” recordings </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">you filed.  As a result, the claim does not provide enough information to enable the Board to understand any alleged similarity of the works.   If you submit a second amended claim, it must include more factual allegations that support the element of substantial similarity.  Please provide more details and background regarding this element, including a clear, detailed statement regarding which portions of your work were used by the respondents and in what portion of the infringing works they appeared.  You may also submit documents or recordings that are sufficient to show the similarities, but the similarities must be apparent; as noted above, the Board cannot hear anything in the recordings of </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“Baile Inolvidable”</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> you submitted that sounds substantially similar to anything in the recordings of </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“HERMOZO ALO”</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> you submitted.  If you again include copies of </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">HERMOZO ALO</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">”</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">and the respondents’ </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">allegedly infringing work as supplemental material, then as discussed above, they must be clearly labeled and identified so they can be properly compared to each other. </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Online Service Provider</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> Your amended claim also includes allegations identifying the respondents a</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">s an “online service provider”</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> (OSP) that do not appear to be correct.   Under the CASE Act, when a claimant raises a copyright infringement claim against an OSP for storing, or referring or linking to, infringing material, the Board must find the claim noncompliant unless the claimant affirms <span style="position:absolute; border: gray 1px solid; left:0px; top:2576px; width:612px; height:792px;"></span>
<div style="position:absolute; top:2576px;"><a name="4">Page 4</a></div>
that the claimant sent a takedown notice to the OSP as required by section 512 of the Copyright Act, and that the OSP failed to remove or disable access to the material expeditiously when it received the takedown notice.  In this context, an OSP is a provider of online services to store (and make available), refer to, provide access to, or link to material that is available online and that was created by someone other than the OSP.  OSPs include content-sharing websites and internet search engines, among other services.  Please visit the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">section 512</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> page and the <span style="position:absolute; border: black 1px solid; left:425px; top:2704px; width:55px; height:0px;"></span>

information about what section 512 of the Copyright Act requires for an infringement claim against an OSP. You can only bring an infringement claim against an OSP if the OSP failed to take down third-party material in response to a proper takedown notice.  You indicate that you have not sent such a notice.  In your responses to questions on the claim form, you allege that at least one respondent is an OSP and that you are bringing the claim against the OSP because it stored, referred, or linked to infringing material posted by others.  However, you </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">responded “No” to the question, “Did </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">you send the online service provider a </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">‘</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">takedown notice</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">’</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> as required by Section 512 of the Copyright Act</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">?” </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> Your claim is not compliant because you state that you are bringing the claim against an OSP based on its actions as an OSP, while you do not allege that the OSP failed to act promptly in response to a takedown notice.   No other information in your amended claim suggests that either of the respondents actually acted as an OSP in relation to infringing material posted by a third party.  If your claim is that the respondents</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">—</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">rather than third parties</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">—</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">committed the allegedly infringing acts, then you can resolve this issue </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">by answering “No” to the question </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">of whether any of the respondents is an OSP. To correct your noncompliant responses to the OSP questions in the claim form, you must provide different responses in a second amended claim.  If neither respondent is an OSP, as discussed above, then you must answer </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">“No” to the question “Are any of the respondents online service providers?” </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> If a respondent is an OSP, and you seek to hold that respondent directly liable for its own actions and not for failing to take down material posted by a </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">third party, then you must answer “No” to the question “Are you</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> bringing a claim against the online service </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">provider due to their storage of or referral or linking to infringing material posted by others?” </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> Finally, if you maintain that a respondent is an OSP, that you sent the OSP a takedown notice, and that the OSP did not promptly </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">redress the third party’s infringement, then you must answer “Yes” to all four OSP questions, including “Did the </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">online service provider fail to expeditiously remove or disable access to the material after you sent a takedown </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">notice?,” an</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">d you must state facts supporting those allegations.  Again, your current factual allegations do not portray any respondent as an OSP. </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Final Amendment</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> Your amended claim resolves some, but not all, of the compliance issues raised in the February 10, 2025 Order to Amend Noncompliant Claim in Docket No. 25-CCB-0029, and it raises additional issues, also discussed in this </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:11px">order, that must be resolved for the claim to move forward.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:11px">This is your third and final opportunity to submit <span style="position:absolute; border: gray 1px solid; left:0px; top:3418px; width:612px; height:792px;"></span>
