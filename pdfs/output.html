reasonable opportunity to view or hear your work before the alleged infringement took place.   To address this issue, you must file an amended claim with allegations that make access a reasonable possibility, not just hypothetically or theoretically possible.  Acceptable allegations of access may include how your work (a) was sent directly to the respondent or a close associate of the respondent; (b) was widely disseminated or was available </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">to the respondent; or (c) is so strikingly similar to the respondent’s work that the respondent could not have created </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">it independently.   </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">In your claim, you state that “Skidmore college has made available my management ebook on an affiliated website in the form of a downloadable pdf file.”  It appears that you may be alleging that the respondent’</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">s upload is identical to your work; however, it is unclear to the Board if that is the case based on the description of the infringement and the supplemental materials uploaded with your claim.  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">If the respondent’s allegedly infringing </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">work is identical to your work and is so strikingly similar to your work that the respondent could not have created it independently, </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">you should expressly state that in the “Describe the infringement” section of the claim.</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">  Alternatively, you can upload copies of your work and the allegedly infringing work if they demonstrate that the works are so strikingly similar that they could not have been created independently.  If you include copies of the works at issue as supplemental documents, they must be clearly labeled and identified so they can be properly compared to each other. </span><span style="font-family: Garamond-Bold; font-size:12px">Relief </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px"> It appears that you are seeking a larger damages award than the CCB can grant for this type of claim.  In your </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">claim you request “I request the payment of the price of my ebook for 2600 students as well as punitive damages.”</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">    The most that respondents can be ordered to pay in damages (actual or statutory) in a CCB proceeding is $30,000.  17 U.S.C. § 1504(e)(1)(D).  You can request both actual and statutory damages in your claim, but you will need to choose one of them before the Board issues a final determination.  Actual damages are money damages awarded based on the proven harm or loss you suffered.  An example of actual damages may be the amount of lost sales revenue you experienced.  Statutory damages are money damages awarded to a successful claimant within a range set by law, without the need to provide proof of the actual amount of harm or loss.  However, the maximum amount of statutory damages available from the CCB is $15,000 for each work that was infringed (or $7,500 per work in instances where the copyright was registered both after the infringement started and not within three </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">months of your work’s first publication). 17 U.S.C. §§ 1504(e)(1)(A)(ii)(I)</span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:12px">-(II).  Further, the Board will not consider willfulness in making an award of statutory damages.  17 U.S.C. § 1504(e)(1)(A)(ii).  In your amended claim, you must request relief within the amount that the board can grant.
